It became an \ninstant classic, and can fairly be said to have started a genre of 4X\n(explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate) space games. Now, SSG is\ndoing a brand new version of the game. \n\nThe original RFTS was a hit because it contained great gameplay, \nexcellent balance, tough AI, great replayability, addiction and fun, \nqualities sadly lacking from many of today's games. The new RFTS is a\ngreat game because it retains those qualities, while expanding the \ngame's scope and vastly improving the interface and graphics.\n\n\nGame Features :\n\nEpic galactic 4X strategy gameplay.\n\n\nLong campaign, more than 20 preset scenarios, plus nearly unlimited\nplay with random scenarios.\n\nSuperior AI makes the computer a cunning and ruthless opponent.\n\nTactical combat with control over fleet formations, attack/defensive\norders and standing orders. Combat will take place as fleet \nengagements, planetary bombardments, and invasions.\n\nA truly dynamic research and technology tree, spread across 10 eras.\n\n16 unique species, each its own technology tree, combat &amp; economic\nadvantages and disadvantages, plus AI personality.\n\nA Diplomatic system that allows for enforceable agreements and\ntreaties between species.\n\nMultiple single and multiplayer victory conditions - can be combined \nfor more variety and challenge.\n\nNetwork play with simultaneous turns up to 4 players on Internet, \nand 6 on a Network.\n\nA powerful Scenario Editor.\n\n\nExtract Archive With Winrar Or 7zip etc.........\n\nThen Mount Image Or Burn To CD\n\nInstall The Game And Play\n\nIf Game Asks For Disc When Started Press Continue Untill Game Starts\n\n\nENJOY AND PLEASE SEED\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b16d963f33187c9d1098e0f2078b0ec1cea51053","amp;dn":"Reach.For.The.Stars.PC.Game%28djDEVASTATE%C3%A2%E2%80%9E%C2%A2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b16d963f33187c9d1098e0f2078b0ec1cea51053","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,109,150,63,51,24,124,157,16,152,224,242,7,139,14,193,206,165,16,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
