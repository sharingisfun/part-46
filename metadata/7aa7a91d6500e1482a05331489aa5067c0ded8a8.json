With shuffling support from pianist George Rhodes, bassist John Brown and drummer Harold Austin, Jones was able to make a lucrative living playing and singing music that did not differ much from what he would have been performing anyway. Other highlights of the LP (which consists of 12 songs from plays) include &quot;The Surrey With the Fringe On Top,&quot; &quot;Just In Time&quot; and &quot;I Could Have Danced All Night.&quot;\n\nTracks info:\n\n1.
