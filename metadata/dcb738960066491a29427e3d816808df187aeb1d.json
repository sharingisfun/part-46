His precocious daughter, Annie, about 10, has failing kidneys. One day, a nearly-drowned young woman comes up in his net; she speaks oddly, calls herself Ondine, and wants no one to see her. He puts her up in an isolated cottage that was his mother's. Annie discovers Ondine's presence and believes she's a selkie, a mythical seal turned human while on land. If this is a fairy tale, is there a happily ever after, or do the realities of alcohol, illness, and worse intrude, including Syracuse's inveterate bad luck? As his priest tell him, misery's easy, it's happiness you have to work at. Any hope of that?\n\nColin Farrell \tColin Farrell \t... \t\nSyracuse\nAlicja Bachleda \tAlicja Bachleda \t... \t\nOndine\nDervla Kirwan \tDervla Kirwan \t... \t\nMaura\nAlison Barry \tAlison Barry \t... \t\nAnnie\nMarion O'Dwyer \tMarion O'Dwyer \t... \t\nNurse - Dialysis\nTony Curran \tTony Curran \t... \t\nAlex\nMary O'Shea \tMary O'Shea \t... \t\nFish Co Op Worker\nGemma Reeves \tGemma Reeves \t... \t\nDraper's Shop Tracy\nStephen Rea \tStephen Rea \t... \t\nPriest\nNorma Sheahan \tNorma Sheahan \t... \t\nLibrarian\nEmil Hostina \tEmil Hostina \t... \t\nVladic\nConor Power \tConor Power \t... \t\nEion\nOlwyn Hanley \tOlwyn Hanley \t... \t\nKatie ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcb738960066491a29427e3d816808df187aeb1d","amp;dn":"ONDINE.m4v","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcb738960066491a29427e3d816808df187aeb1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,183,56,150,0,102,73,26,41,66,126,61,129,104,8,223,24,122,235,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
