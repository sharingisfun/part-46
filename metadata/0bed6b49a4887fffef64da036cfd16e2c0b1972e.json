Between 1968 and 1973, Ten Years After scored eight Top 40 albums on the UK Albums Chart. In addition they have had twelve albums enter the US Billboard 200, and are best known for tracks like &quot;I'm Going Home&quot;, &quot;Hear Me Calling&quot;, &quot;Rock'n Roll Music to the World&quot;, &quot;I'd Love to Change the World&quot; and &quot;Love Like a Man&quot;.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTen Years After is the debut album by the English rock/blues band Ten Years After. It features &quot;Spoonful&quot;, a cover that the more famous British blues rock group Cream also covered. The album is also low on original material in comparison to the band's later works which were, in most cases, entirely composed of Alvin Lee's songs.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bed6b49a4887fffef64da036cfd16e2c0b1972e","amp;dn":"Ten+Years+After+-+Ten+Years+After+%5B1967%5D%5B2002%5D%5B320KBPS%5D%5BRMSTD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bed6b49a4887fffef64da036cfd16e2c0b1972e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,237,107,73,164,136,127,255,239,100,218,3,108,253,22,226,192,177,151,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
