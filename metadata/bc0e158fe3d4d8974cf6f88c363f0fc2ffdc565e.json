Aside from his tenure with Fleetwood Mac, Buckingham has also released five solo albums and a live album. He is married to photographer Kristen Messner and has three children. As a member of Fleetwood Mac, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998.\n\nDuring the time he worked on Tusk, Buckingham also produced albums for Walter Egan and John Stewart in the late 1970s as well as beginning work on his own solo album.\n\nIn 1981, Buckingham released his first solo album Law and Order, playing nearly every instrument and featuring guest appearances by bandmates Mick Fleetwood and Christine McVie. The album pursued the quirky, eclectic, often lo-fi and new-wave-influences of Tusk, and spawned the hit single &quot;Trouble&quot;, a slice of Southern California Beach Boys-inspired pop that reached #9 on the US Charts and #1 in Australia (for three weeks). Two years later, he wrote and performed the songs &quot;Holiday Road&quot; and &quot;Dancin' Across the U.S.A.&quot; for the film National Lampoon's Vacation. &quot;Holiday Road&quot; was released as a single, but reached only #82 on the Billboard's Hot 100. He did other soundtrack work, including the song &quot;Time Bomb Town&quot; from Back to the Future (1985).\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc0e158fe3d4d8974cf6f88c363f0fc2ffdc565e","amp;dn":"Lindsey+Buckingham+-+Holiday+Road","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc0e158fe3d4d8974cf6f88c363f0fc2ffdc565e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,14,21,143,227,212,216,151,76,246,248,140,54,63,15,194,255,220,86,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
