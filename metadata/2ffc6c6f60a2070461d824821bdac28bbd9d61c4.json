Gore Verbinski directed the film, as he did with the previous two. It was shot in two shoots during 2005 and 2006, the former simultaneously with the preceding film, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&amp;#039;s Chest.\n\nThe plot follows the crew of the Black Pearl rescuing Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), from Davy Jones&amp;#039; Locker, and then preparing to fight the East India Trading Company, led by Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) and Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), who plan to extinguish piracy. The film was released in English-speaking countries on May 24, 2007 after Disney opted to move the release date to a day earlier than originally planned. Critical reviews were mixed, but At World&amp;#039;s End was a box office hit, becoming the most successful film of the year.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ffc6c6f60a2070461d824821bdac28bbd9d61c4","amp;dn":"Pirates+of+the+Caribbean+%28At+Worlds+End%29+-+English-+MP4+%28Full+Ve","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ffc6c6f60a2070461d824821bdac28bbd9d61c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,252,108,111,96,162,7,4,97,216,36,130,27,218,194,139,189,157,97,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
