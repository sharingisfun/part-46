CODE COMPLETE provides a larger perspective on the software-development process and the role of construction in the process\n\nFrom the Publisher\nFrom the Author&amp;#039;s Preface: My primary concern in writing this book has been to narrow the gap between the knowledge of industry gurus and professors on one hand and common commercial practice on the other. Although leading-edge software-development practice has advanced rapidly in recent years, common practice hasn&amp;#039;t. Many programs are still buggy, late, and over budget, and many fail to satisfy the needs of users. The research and programming experience collected in this book will help you to create high-quality software and do your work more quickly and with fewer problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f702ce10c4652be093a1bf5302680a920097e1b","amp;dn":"Code+Complete%2C+2nd+Edition+%282004%29.chm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f702ce10c4652be093a1bf5302680a920097e1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,112,44,225,12,70,82,190,9,58,27,245,48,38,128,169,32,9,126,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
