Denis Cooverman (Paul Rust) may have brains to spare; it's \nguts that he lacks -- or at least, he did until today. Stepping up to the podium to deliver an inspirational speech to his \ngraduating class, Denis decides that the time has finally come to call out his classmates on their peccadilloes and declare his \nlove for the prettiest girl in school - Beth Cooper (Hayden Panettiere). Much to Denis' surprise, Beth responds by accepting an \ninvitation to a party at his house later that day. But Beth's meathead boyfriend Kevin (Shawn Roberts) is none-too-pleased that \nhis high school prize is mingling with the biggest dweeb in school, and when Kevin shows up at his house and tears the place \napart in a fit of rage Denis, his best friend Rich (Jack Carpenter), Beth, and her friends Cammy (Lauren London) and Treece \n(Lauren Storm) all pile into Beth's car and flee for their lives. For four long years Denis sat silently behind Beth in class, \npining for a way to make his love known. Now, over the course of one long night, Denis will finally get to know the girl of his \ndreams better than he ever thought possible. If he manages to survive until morning, it's sure to be the story of a lifetime.\n\n \nHayden Panettiere ... Beth Cooper\nPaul Rust ... Denis Cooverman\nJack Carpenter ... Rich Munsch (as Jack T.
