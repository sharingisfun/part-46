After a field-trip to goes badly wrong, Verity is forced to redeem herself by participating in a dangerous mission, for which her expertise is invaluable.\r\n\r\nUsing a backdoor into an unstable alien transit system, Auger's faction has discovered something astonishing at the far end of a wormhole: mid twentieth-century Earth, preserved like a fly in amber. Is it a window into the past, a simulation, or something else entirely?\r\n\r\nCENTURY RAIN is not just a time-travel story, nor a tale of alternate history. Part hard SF thriller, part interstellar adventure, part noir romance, CENTURY RAIN is something altogether stranger.\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by John Lee\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:670cec0651160b93670e775a39f21f60fa36cfa1","amp;dn":"Alastair+Reynolds+-+Century+Rain","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"670cec0651160b93670e775a39f21f60fa36cfa1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,12,236,6,81,22,11,147,103,14,119,90,57,242,31,96,250,54,207,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
