Delsaz &quot;snarfquack&quot; (Miami, FL USA) -\n\nBack in 91-92 I was infatuated with the shoegazer movement. I was totally lost in the gorgeous walls of sound of My Bloody Valentine, the soothing harmonies of Slowdive, the fragile beauty of the Boo Radleys, and the distortion feedback of Medicine. This album, from an unknown Boston band, soon became one of my absolute favorites of the era. Delaware, Winona and Kick the Tragedy are literally three of the best songs ive heard in my entire life (and I'm a music freak with well over a 1,000 CD's so I've heard it all and then some). Kick the Tragedy holds a special place in my heart. Its hard to describe but completely captures what was best about the shoegazer movement. The song is mostly instrumental but has a dreamy surreal quality about it. Mid-song a girl starts to ramble. It may sound incoherent at first but if you really listen it actually starts to make a lot of sense. The subject deals with growing up and loss of innocence, as well as disillusionment. I'd say its a fair candidate for best song to ever come out of the period. Check this album out. You will not be disappointed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c62fcbadf1f29e0eea8895a951a2740c382ccac5","amp;dn":"Drop+Nineteens+-+Delaware+%281992%29+%5BVBR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c62fcbadf1f29e0eea8895a951a2740c382ccac5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,47,203,173,241,242,158,14,234,136,149,169,81,162,116,12,56,44,202,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
