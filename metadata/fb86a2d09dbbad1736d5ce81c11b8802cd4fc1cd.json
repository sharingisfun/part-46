Great! But what parts of England do you\nwant to visit? The country stretches from the English Channel in\nthe south to the Scottish border in the north, and from Wales and the\nIrish Sea in the west to the North Sea in the east. England isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a huge\ncountry Ã¢â‚¬â€ you can drive its length in a day Ã¢â‚¬â€ but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s packed with sightseeing\npossibilities.\nI have a hunch that London is on your itinerary, but what other cities,\nregions, or specific attractions do you want to see? The walled city of\nYork? Stratford-upon-Avon, the birthplace of William Shakespeare? Are\nyou interested in nightclubbing at a seaside resort, like Brighton, or\nstrolling through an elegant 18th-century spa town, like Bath? Are there\nspecific landscapes you want to see, such as the Yorkshire moors or the\ncliffs of Cornwall? What castles, cathedrals, stately homes, and gardens\ndo you want to visit? And how about other historic sites? Do you want to\nvisit Roman ruins, spend all day in the Tower of London, or walk around\nthe field where the Normans and the Saxons fought the Battle of\nHastings in 1066? England promises so much to see, do, and enjoy that\nyou may find planning a trip here a real challenge.\nBut donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t worry, lucky traveler Ã¢â‚¬â€ in this book, I help you assemble your\nperfect itinerary from EnglandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sightseeing riches. With a bit of planning\nand some useful information under your belt, you may find taking\nthat trip to England much easier than you thought.\nAbout This Book\nThis book serves as a selective guide to England. By definition, England\nis the southern part of Great Britain, excluding Wales. Wales and\nScotland, although part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\nNorthern Ireland, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t appear in this book.\nMy goal throughout this book is to give you a good selection of the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\nhighlights, which means I exclude places that other, more exhaustive\nguidebooks routinely include. Birmingham, Manchester, and Bristol\nare important cities, but from the perspective of a first-time visitor to\nEngland, they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have much to offer. England has so much worth\nseeing that you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need to waste your time with the second-rate, the\noverrated, or the boring.\nUse this book as a reference guide. You can, of course, start at the first\npage and read all the way through to the end. Or, if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve already been\nto England and know the basics of international travel, you can easily\nflip to the specific part you need or home in on one specific chapter.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pdfdummies.com/category/i/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pdfdummies.com/category/i/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb86a2d09dbbad1736d5ce81c11b8802cd4fc1cd","amp;dn":"England.For.Dummies.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb86a2d09dbbad1736d5ce81c11b8802cd4fc1cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,134,162,208,157,187,173,23,54,213,206,129,193,27,136,2,205,79,193,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
