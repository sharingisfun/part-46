This state-of-the-art technology is the foundation on which Battlefield 3 is built, delivering enhanced visual quality, a grand sense of scale, massive destruction, dynamic audio and incredibly lifelike character animations. As bullets whiz by, walls crumble, and explosions throw you to the ground, the battlefield feels more alive and interactive than ever before. In Battlefield 3, players step into the role of the elite U.S. Marines where they will experience heart-pounding missions across diverse locations including Paris, Tehran and New York.\n\n\nnotes:\nClose Origin.\nDownload\nOnce downloaded, unzip file and upload the folder to: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Origin Games\\Battlefield 3 Beta Trial\\\nOpen Origin.\nEnter Key to Origin.\nOnce authenticated, it will start &quot;installing&quot; BF3 Beta.\nIt will find the files on the folder and if there are no new updates, the game will be ready to play.\nIf there are updates, let it update, then start when ready.\nIf there are issues with the install, remove the folder from the Program files folder and restart origin and load the game through Origin download.
