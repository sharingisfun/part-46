The band had relocated to London by 1970, and they released their self-titled debut album in 1971. Both Nazareth and 1972's Exercises received favorable attention by British hard rockers, but it was 1973's Razamanaz that moved them into the U.K. Top Ten (both &quot;Broken Down Angel&quot; and &quot;Bad Bad Boy&quot; were hit singles). Loud 'n' Proud and Rampant (both 1974) followed the same formula, yet were slightly less successful.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\n\n\n01.This Flight Tonight\n02.Expect No Mercy\n03.Love Hurts\n04.Morning Dew\n05.Carry Out Feelings\n06.Hair Of The Dog\n07.Razamanaz\n08.Love Leads To Madness\n09.I Want To (Do Everything )\n10.Holiday\n11.Star\n12.Dressed To Kill\n13.Broken Down Angel\n14.My White Bicycle\n15.Heart's Grown Cold\n16.Shanghai'd In Shanghai\n17.Go Down Fighting\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57c1d9d8b6067fcd723ce3e836a4802955d909ff","amp;dn":"Nazareth+-+Classics+Vol.+16+%281990%29+%5BCD+Rip%5D+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57c1d9d8b6067fcd723ce3e836a4802955d909ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,193,217,216,182,6,127,205,114,60,227,232,54,164,128,41,85,217,9,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
