I wish they will get back together again and create more!\n\nComplete album. Encoded using Itunes at 320Kbps AAC.  Each track has the album artwork and proper ID3 tag. This is the best compressed format/bitrate for me right now. Use Itunes to play, or download an AAC plugin for your player or convert it to Mp3 if you want.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1\tDamien\n2\tLush\n3\tHeater\n4\tMuera\n5\tKrolithika\n6\tVylet\n7\tKarmela\n8\tPowder\n9\tLie\n10\tModelo\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:111dac541d2818f082ccfa0545c0f0096b8d51fa","amp;dn":"%5BERROR%21+Download+other+torrent%21%5D+Saydie+-+Saydie+%28Self-Titled%29+%28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"111dac541d2818f082ccfa0545c0f0096b8d51fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,29,172,84,29,40,24,240,130,204,250,5,69,192,240,9,107,141,81,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
