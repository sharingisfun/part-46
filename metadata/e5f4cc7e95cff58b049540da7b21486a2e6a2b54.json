Familiar they may be, but some credit has to go to De Backer for managing to weave these eclectic retro sounds into a cohesive affair, which proves that along with recent efforts by Art vs. Science and Architecture in Helsinki, Australia is fast becoming one of the biggest purveyors of quality experimental pop.\n\nReleased: Sept 6, 2011\nGenre: Electronic\nStyle: Indie Electronic, Pop, Experimental\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nChannels: Stereo\nSample Rate: 44,100 Hz\nBit Rate: ~800 kbps\nBits per Sample: 16\nCovers: Front\n\nTracks:\n\n 1.
