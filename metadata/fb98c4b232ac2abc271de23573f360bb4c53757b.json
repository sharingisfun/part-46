Mitch jokes about how he and Eric were at Gene Simmons house \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;just fooling around.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; Mitch wanted to try something different, so he sat inside a closet with his microphone and belted out this easy flowing song. In the meantime, Eric Carr programmed the drum machine, played some guitars, and added some background vocals. Written and performed by Eric Carr and Mitch Weissman.\n\nTrack 05 : \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;No One\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Messin\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' With You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; : This song was discovered on an old DAT recording owned and made by Eric Carr in 1989.

When Mark heard that there was a new Eric Carr CD in the works, he was eager to be part of it. Weeks before Mark\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s death he was in the process of creating some heavy guitar parts for the song. Sadly, Mark St. John pasted away in 2007, before he could complete them.
