But when someone shows up from their past, the frustration resurfaces for some and Hulk Hogan is forced to step in and take charge. Special guest Former WCW and WWE Champion Bill Goldberg motivates the celebrities -- some with words and others with pure pain.\n\n\n\nThis is SDH release #542 for the wrestling fans from a wrestling fan.\nFirst Aired and Captured on: 11/22/2008 on the CMT HD channel\non DirecTv HDTV Digital Satellite Broadcast then converted to \n16:9 widescreen 624 x 352 resolution \nin a 350mb Nero Digital .mp4 release \nwith 128 kbps mp3 audio\nThis SDH release is Philips DVD - DivX player model # DVP3962 compatible \n\n\nAlso I want to address an issue I have with this program. DirecTv claims CMT HD is broadcasted in HDTV but in reality it is NOT broadcasted in 16:9 widescreen it is broadcasted in 4:3 fullscreen with the black pillar bars on the left and right side of the screen which clearly indicate that it is simply being upconverted to HD but upconverted 480i programming is not TRUE HDTV sad but true. Also this program has black bars not just on the left and right but top and bottom as well during the broadcast which puts the program in a box surrounded by black bars. I will do the best I can to make a decent widescreen release out of this show but if it comes out looking bad then you can blame it on CMT which are a bunch of IDIOTS who claim it is in widescreen HD when it is NOT broadcasted in HD. \n\nAlso I resent the fact that the scene group aAF claims it is HDTV when I have clearly proved that it isn&amp;#039;t in HDTV. If anyone from the scene group aAF wants to dispute this fact then JUST BRING IT because I will be waiting for you aAF jabroni&amp;#039;s to PROVE ME WRONG.
