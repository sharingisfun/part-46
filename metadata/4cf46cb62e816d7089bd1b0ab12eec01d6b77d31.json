But Santa&amp;#039;s got problems (he&amp;#039;s even mysteriously losing weight) and things quickly go south when he finds out that his son, Charlie, has landed on this year&amp;#039;s &quot;naughty&quot; list. Desperate to help his son, Scott heads back home, leaving a substitute Claus to watch over things at the Pole. But when the substitute institutes some strange redefinitions of naughty and nice, putting Christmas at risk, it&amp;#039;s up to Scott to return with a new bag of magic to try to save Christmas.\n\n\nEnjoy and donÃ‚Â´t forget to share.\n\nYou can visit www.dvdquorum.es for more downloads.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cf46cb62e816d7089bd1b0ab12eec01d6b77d31","amp;dn":"Santa+Clause+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cf46cb62e816d7089bd1b0ab12eec01d6b77d31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,244,108,182,46,129,109,112,137,189,27,10,177,46,236,1,214,183,125,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
