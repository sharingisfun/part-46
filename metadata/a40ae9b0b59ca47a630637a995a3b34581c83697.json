Analytic approximations often break down as nonlinearity becomes strong, and even perturbation approximations are valid only for problems with weak nonlinearity.\n\nThis book introduces a powerful new analytic method for nonlinear problems-homotopy analysis-that remains valid even with strong nonlinearity. In Part I, the author starts with a very simple example, then presents the basic ideas, detailed procedures, and the advantages (and limitations) of homotopy analysis. Part II illustrates the application of homotopy analysis to many interesting nonlinear problems. These range from simple bifurcations of a nonlinear boundary-value problem to the Thomas-Fermi atom model, Volterra's population model, Von KÃƒÂ¡rmÃƒÂ¡n swirling viscous flow, and nonlinear progressive waves in deep water.\n\nAlthough the homotopy analysis method has been verified in a number of prestigious journals, it has yet to be fully detailed in book form. Written by a pioneer in its development, Beyond Pertubation: Introduction to the Homotopy Analysis Method is your first opportunity to explore the details of this valuable new approach, add it to your analytic toolbox, and perhaps make contributions to some of the questions that remain open.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReviews:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe author has invested a great amount of effort into determining all the power series and computing the functions depicted in the figures.\n--Mathematical Reviews, Issue 2005h\n\n...an excellent reference to researchers, engineers, and interested individuals in helping them tackle nonlinear problems in an analytical fashionÃ¢â‚¬Â¦a good subject index and an outstanding list of bibliography with 136 references citedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦very well written and is relatively easy to follow to the mathematically literate person. I highly recommend that it be acquired by interested individuals and libraries throughout.\n--Applied Mathematics Review, Vol. 57, No. 5, September 2004\n\nThis monograph offers the opportunity to explore the details of the valuable new approach both in the theory and on many interesting examples. It will be useful to specialists working in applied nonlinear analysis.\n--Zentralblatt MATH 1051\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo Password or Surveys.
