But when she was bad she was horrid!\n\nPearl can be very, very good. More often, though, she is very, very bad. But sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just a child. A mystery to all who know her; a little girl who has her own secret reasons for escaping to the nearby woods. What might those reasons be? And how can she feel so at home in the dark, sinister, sensual woods, a wonder of secrets and mystery?\n\nTold in vignettes across PearlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s childhood years, Reasons She Goes To The Woods is a nervy and lyrical novel about a girl growing up who is trying to be normal, even though she doesn't know quite what normal is.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85a71a140e886f917892e94b0fee6b610eae5ec4","amp;dn":"Reasons+She+Goes+to+the+Woods+-+Deborah+Kay+Davies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85a71a140e886f917892e94b0fee6b610eae5ec4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,167,26,20,14,136,111,145,120,146,233,75,15,238,107,97,14,174,94,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
