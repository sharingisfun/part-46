This exhaustive three-year inquest involved multiple trips to the scene of the crime in Arlington, Virginia, close scrutiny of all official and unofficial data related to the event, and, most importantly, first-person interviews with dozens of eyewitnesses, many of which were conducted and filmed in the exact locations from which they witnessed the plane that allegedly struck the building that day.\n\nBe forewarned: Our findings are extraordinarily shocking and frightening. They are also deadly serious, and deserving of your immediate attention. This is not about a conspiracy theory or any theory at all. This is about independent, verifiable evidence which unfortunately happens to conclusively establish as a historical fact that the violence which took place in Arlington that day was not the result of a surprise attack by suicide hijackers, but rather a false flag &quot;black operation&quot; involving a carefully planned and skillfully executed deception.\n\nIf you are skeptical of (or even incensed by) this statement we do not blame you. We are not asking you to take our word for it, nor do we want you to do that. We want you to view the evidence and see with your own eyes that this is the case. We want you to hear it directly from the eyewitnesses who were there, just as we did.\n\nPlease understand that this information is not being brought to your attention simply for educational purposes. It is presented within the context of a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcall to actionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ accompanied by a detailed step-by-step strategy intended to inspire and empower you to do something about it. But first, please familiarize yourself with the evidence by viewing and paying close attention to the 81-minute video presentation, National Security Alert.\n\nThank you for your concern and thank you for your action.\n\nSincerely,\n\nCraig Ranke and Aldo Marquis\n\nCitizen Investigation Team","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:874927abdc1eec232aef14d66d0ccb8537ecb1a2","amp;dn":"National+Security+Alert+from+the+Citizen+Investigation+Team","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"874927abdc1eec232aef14d66d0ccb8537ecb1a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,73,39,171,220,30,236,35,42,239,20,214,109,12,203,133,55,236,177,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
