After a couple of months Henrik Weide joined on vocals and Ronni Bech on bass.\n\nAOC is in it for the long haul, we love what we do, and you can expect a lot more coming from us in the future!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96539e43a2c59646cf8adee8f9bb2efe0d1071f9","amp;dn":"Act+Of+Cohesion+-+Submission+and+Fairytales+-+EP_2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96539e43a2c59646cf8adee8f9bb2efe0d1071f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,83,158,67,162,197,150,70,207,138,222,232,249,187,46,254,13,16,113,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
