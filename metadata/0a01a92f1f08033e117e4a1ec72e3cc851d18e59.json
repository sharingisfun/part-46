Oliver plays guitar, bass and all manner of electronics - he is also a long-time family member of city centre offices having recorded 2 albums and an ep under the&quot;Dictaphone&quot; moniker in between composing and performing musical pieces for theatre, installations and film over the last few years. Stephan plays piano and drums, arranging an almost neo-classical structure within a recording that already sounds ghostly and cinematic.\n\n\nSWOD represents a labour of love from two musicians experienced in the art of seductive and evocative music making. having firstworked together producing live soundtracks to silent movies, Oliver Doerell and Stephan WÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶hrmann tread a delicate board of crystalline piano cascades and the sort of subtle electronic tinkering you can barely recognise or absorb in one sitting. It's fitting that the pair are so used to tailor-making their\nharmonious shards of sound to moving imagery, &quot;gehen&quot; evokes a plethora of half forgotten films and life experiences offered up in glimpses in the back of your mind.\nif you can imagine a sitting specially programmed by film directors ThÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©o Angelopoulos or Krzysztof Kieslowski, you'll have some idea of what to expect.
