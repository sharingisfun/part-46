But revolutionary new archaeological data and the latest DNA research reveal that Europeans visited our shores far earlier ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ some 17,000 years before Columbus was even born.\n\nFilmed in glorious high definition, this two-hour, epic drama follows an intrepid family of stone age hunters as they trek from their homeland in southwestern France, cross 3,000 miles of ocean and eventually make their first permanent settlement in what is today the northeastern U.S. Along the way, they overcome starvation and storms with the help of a revolutionary weapons technology they would later bequeath to the native peoples of the Americas. But awaiting the pioneers' arrival is a stark, empty continent, filled with a plethora of bizarre and lethal animals ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ all brought to life by brilliant computer animation. Firmly rooted in the latest scientific discoveries, it's a compelling vision of the greatest migration in human history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0be8bc6141596b6df2f9c7bb2766bbd4f9fa2788","amp;dn":"Discovery+Channel+-+Ice+Age+Columbus%3A+Who+Where+The+First+Americ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0be8bc6141596b6df2f9c7bb2766bbd4f9fa2788","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,232,188,97,65,89,107,109,242,249,199,187,39,102,187,212,249,250,39,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
