Track information and cover art may therefore not be available for all of them. I went and checked at Amazon.com for each one to verify that they were out of print; some are available used, one was listed for SIXTY DOLLARS (!) and some simply didn&amp;#039;t exist. These are lost treasures. Keep them well for me.\n\nTo save time and space, I ripped these at 320 kb rather than in Windows Lossless. As before, there are five torrents in total. This one includes:\n\nAdam de la Halle- Le Jeu de Robin et Marian (Ensemble Perceval)\nArs Magis Subtiliter: Secular Music from the Chantilly Codex (Ensemble PAN)\nSacred Bridge- Jews and Christmas in Medieval Europe (Boston Camerata)\nLo Gai Saber (Camerata Mediterranea)\n\nBe certain to download my other torrents of medieval and archaic music! Enjoy -- and keep seeding!\n\n-- Rivenshield","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:067ac9a569c9bbd8bf5477402e6e4f634e584ff2","amp;dn":"Music+of+the+Middle+Ages+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"067ac9a569c9bbd8bf5477402e6e4f634e584ff2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,122,201,165,105,201,187,216,191,84,119,64,46,110,79,99,78,88,79,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
