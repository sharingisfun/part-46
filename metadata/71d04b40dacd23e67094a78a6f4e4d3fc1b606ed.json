They catch some fish for lunch, and on the way back they stop at the Margaret River Farmers Market and find the freshest garlic in town. Matt decides to use the fish he caught in his classic Spanish wet rice dish and also makes sticky Vietnamese pork paired with green mango and papaya salad. Later, they call into the highly awarded Woodlands Estate to pick some famous Cabernet, but when they're confronted by the winemaker and his Hollywood filmmaker friend dressed in beekeeping outfits ready for a raid, the boys naturally get involved, desperate to taste some sticky amber gold. As night falls, they drive to the local Bunbury amateur Astronomy Society where Alex gets to live his childhood passion and experiences the constellations of the southern sky for the first time.\n\n\n\n\nRebroadcast Air Date: 24-Sep-2014 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71d04b40dacd23e67094a78a6f4e4d3fc1b606ed","amp;dn":"Recipes.That.Rock.S01E03.HDTV.x264-Hector.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71d04b40dacd23e67094a78a6f4e4d3fc1b606ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,208,75,64,218,205,35,230,112,148,167,138,111,78,77,63,193,182,6,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
