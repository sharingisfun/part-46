As a testament to Hubble&amp;#039;s work cataloging and classifying huge numbers of galaxies in the 1920s, HST has imaged hundreds of thousands of extra-galactic objects, as well as many in our own galaxy, the Milky Way. Perhaps the single most astonishing disproof of creationism; light that left galaxies as long as 13.7 Billion years ago combined with HST&amp;#039;s technological eyes have brought scientists closer than ever before to understanding the early Universe.\n\nErrata: At 3:00, I included the wrong image. It is not the horsehead portion of the Orion Nebula, but rather a column of the Eagle Nebula (M-16)\n\nPlease leave a comment if you want, this is just to show what is out there...\n\nAnd before you go and spam, dl it watch it and make up your own mind...\n\ncheers the_phyrexian\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:560a92f12a0ab6791e21c44c98a14431e091722a","amp;dn":"Welcome+to+Hubble%5C%27s+Universe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"560a92f12a0ab6791e21c44c98a14431e091722a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,10,146,241,42,10,182,121,30,33,196,76,152,161,68,49,224,145,114,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
