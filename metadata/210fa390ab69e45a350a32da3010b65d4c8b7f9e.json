Beginning with the haunting melody of Honour This Land, the album builds to a peak of rock orchestration in the epic When Darkness Takes Flight, propelled by powerful drumming reminiscent of the late John Bonham. Dynamically recorded with sparse arrangements and great sonics, the result is a cohesive tale of a mature artist. This is instrumental music that commands to be heard - at a healthy volume - offering a depth that will reveal new insights with each listen.\n\nray montford - guitars, textures\nbrilliantfish - percussion, textures, keys, voice\njohn dymond - bass\ngeorge koller - cello\nsteve o'connor - piano, B-3\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 - Honour This Land\n02 - Temporary Asylum\n03 - Blind to Beauty\n04 - When Darkness Takes Flight\n05 - Arrival\n06 - Remember\n07 - The Healing\n08 - I Hear You Now\n09 - Belive in Angels\n10 - Two Lives","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:210fa390ab69e45a350a32da3010b65d4c8b7f9e","amp;dn":"Ray+Montford+-+A+Fragile+Balance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"210fa390ab69e45a350a32da3010b65d4c8b7f9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,15,163,144,171,105,228,90,53,10,50,218,48,16,182,93,76,139,127,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
