He tests the limits of love when Hugh lances a boil from his backside, and pushes the boundaries of laziness when, finding the water shut off in his house in Normandy, he looks to the water in a vase of fresh cut flowers to fill the coffee machine. From armoring the windows with LP covers to protect the house from neurotic songbirds to the awkwardness of having a lozenge fall from your mouth into the lap of a sleeping fellow passenger on a plane, David Sedaris uses life&amp;#039;s most bizarre moments to reach new heights in understanding love and fear, family and strangers. Culminating in a brilliantly funny (and never before published) account of his venture to Tokyo in order to quit smoking, David Sedaris&amp;#039;s sixth essay collection will be avidly anticipated.&quot;\n\n---\nmp3 format\n---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de141baec642b326f48be3274ae485b4f3610772","amp;dn":"David+Sedaris+-+When+You+Are+Engulfed+In+Flames+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de141baec642b326f48be3274ae485b4f3610772","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,20,27,174,198,66,179,38,244,139,227,39,74,228,133,180,243,97,7,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
