He came to the United States after serving in the French army during the early part of World War II and had taught for four years at Williams College in the Williams-MIT joint arts and engineering program. Following his service at Williams College, Ferd joined the faculty of Lehigh University where he taught for thirty-seven years. He held several positions, including the University Distinguished Professors Chair and Chairman of the Mechanical Engineering and Mechanics Department, and in 1995 Ferd was awarded an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree by Lehigh University.\n\nBorn in Philadelphia, Russ holds a B.S. degree in civil engineering from the University of Delaware and an Sc.D. degree in the field of structural engineering from The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He taught at Lehigh University and Worchester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) before joining the faculty of the University of Connecticut where he held the position of Chairman of the Civil Engineering Department and taught for twenty-six years. In 1991 Russ received the Outstanding Civil Engineer Award from the Connecticut Section of the American Society of Civil Engineers.\n\nDavid holds a B.S. degree in ocean engineering and a M.S. degree in civil engineering from the Florida Institute of Technology, and a Ph.D. degree in civil engineering from the University of Connecticut. He was employed by General Dynamics Corporation Electric Boat Division for five years, where he provided submarine construction support and conducted engineering design and analysis associated with pressure hull and other structures. In addition, he conducted research in the area of noise and vibration transmission reduction in submarines. He then taught at Lafayette College for one year prior to joining the civil engineering faculty at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, where he has been since 1990. David is currently a member of the American Railway Engineering &amp; Maintenance-of-way Association Committee 15 (Steel Structures), and the American Society of Civil Engineers Committee on Blast, Shock, and Vibratory Effects. He has also worked with the Federal Railroad Administration on their bridge inspection training program. Professional interests include bridge engineering, railroad engineering, tall towers, structural forensics, and blast-resistant design. He is a licensed professional engineer in Connecticut and Pennsylvania.\n\nPhil received his B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Texas Tech University in 1985 and his M.A. and Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1987 and 1989 respectively. His present interests include structural dynamics, structural health monitoring, that is damage detection in structures using changes their vibration characteristics, and undergraduate engineering education. Phil spends his summers working at Los Alamos National Laboratory where he is a mentor in the Los Alamos Dynamics Summer School and he does research in the area of structural health monitoring. He has received an SAE Ralph R. Teetor Educational Award in 1992, the DeanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Outstanding Teacher award at Rose-Hulman in 2000 and the Rose-Hulman Board of Trustees Outstanding Scholar Award in 2001. Phil is on the executive committee of the Mechanics Division of the American Society of Engineering Education.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bf72e3bd661cfc52ff86e8a8c8340cdaebdacf2","amp;dn":"Vector+Mechanics+for+Engineers%3A+Statics+and+Dynamics+10th+ed.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bf72e3bd661cfc52ff86e8a8c8340cdaebdacf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,247,46,59,214,97,207,197,47,248,110,138,140,131,64,205,174,189,172,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
