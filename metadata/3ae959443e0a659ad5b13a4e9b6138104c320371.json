This is not what is on the official &quot;The Truth And The Light: Music From The X-Files&quot; album from 1996\n\n===\n\ntracklist:\n\n01 Lamenta (Song Of Sorrow) (Suite Mix)\n02 Introitus: Praeceps Transito Spatium (Introduction: On The Edge Of Travel Through Space) (Suite Mix)\n03 Materia Primoris: The X-Files Theme (Suite Mix)\n04 Raptus (Abduction) (Suite Mix)\n05 Adelatus (Inspired Breath) (Suite Mix)\n06 Deverbero (A Sound Thrashing) (Suite Mix)\n07 Cantus Excio (Chant Of Exorcism) (Suite Mix)\n08 Mercutura (The Merchandise) (Suite Mix)\n09 Insequi (Hot Pursuit) (Suite Mix)\n10 Otium (Peace) (Suite Mix)\n11 Dubitatio (In Doubt) (Suite Mix)\n12 Iter (Journey) (Suite Mix)\n13 Progigno De Axis (The Offspring Of Axis) (Suite Mix)\n14 Facetus Malum (Comic Misfortune) (Suite Mix)\n15 Memoria (Remembrance) (Suite Mix)\n16 Mitis Lumen (Soft Light) (Suite Mix)\n17 The X-Files Suite Epilogue\n\n===\n\nThe biggest difference between this release and &quot;The Truth And The Light&quot; is that there are no spoken parts- no audio clips from the series! There is only music with in addition is mixed in a differenr way. In some pieces you almost won't hear what is to be distinguished [&quot;Iter&quot;] but in others you will hear it very clearly [&quot;Materia Primoris&quot;]. All of the tracks here are taken from &quot;Suite From The X-Files&quot; which can be found on &quot;The Snow Files&quot; [http://musicbrainz.org/release/ef258fd2-c106-4525-a3b9-16c9d49b7357.html]. There is nothing more and nothing less in this Suite than there is in this release. [And so: &quot;The Truth And The Light&quot; contains 4 more tracks but there isn't tgis one which is at the end of Suite - #17]. The track list order is as it goes on the Suite [partially different than on &quot;The Truth And The Light&quot;]\n\n===\n\nI've remasterd all of the tracks by adjusting the volume or making them lauder where it needed to be done [without quality lost] and also cleaned them of any pitches / glitches- this is why I take credit for this bootleg album\n\n===\n\nThere will be more rare / remastered music coming up. I have a low upload but I will keep seeding this torrent for weeks\n\nDownload\nEnjoy\nShare","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ae959443e0a659ad5b13a4e9b6138104c320371","amp;dn":"%5BM+Remastered%5D+The+X-Files+%28Suite+Mix%29+%231996%23+Mark+Snow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ae959443e0a659ad5b13a4e9b6138104c320371","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,233,89,68,62,10,101,154,213,177,58,78,155,97,56,16,76,50,3,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
