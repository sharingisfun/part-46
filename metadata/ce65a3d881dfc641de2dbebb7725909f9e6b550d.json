Awesome series published by the folks at Heavy Metal and painted by Simon Bisley.\n\nI *think* this is the complete story, with the first 2/3 represented by Book 1 and Book 2, and the last part split into 3 digital issues.\n\nAll credit goes to the scanner, Cypher-Empire! Please seed and share with our friends here at TPB!\n\n------\n\nFrom Amazon:\n\nRaised by the Order of Solomon, Adam Cahill is one of a rare handful of highly trained warriors bound by bloodline to guard the Seven Holy Seals that contain the End of Days. But ageless forces have conspired towards a prophetic event foretold by numerous cultures and multiple religions, and when that cryptic date arrives, they strike against the order without mercy! Adam's world is shattered, his family murdered, and he is sent spiraling into Hell itself. There, he must find three corrupt souls, chosen by Divinity, to join him in battle against the legendary Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Together, these broken individuals must band together to not only save their own souls, but to decide the fate of Humanity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce65a3d881dfc641de2dbebb7725909f9e6b550d","amp;dn":"The+Four+Horsemen+of+the+Apocalypse+%282012%29+%28Digital%29+%28Cypher-Emp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce65a3d881dfc641de2dbebb7725909f9e6b550d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,101,163,216,129,223,198,65,222,45,190,187,119,37,144,159,158,107,85,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
