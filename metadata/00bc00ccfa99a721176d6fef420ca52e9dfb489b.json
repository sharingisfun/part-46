This is some more of the real stuff: blues during the Great Depression and then later on. There are many seemingly obscure names on this remastered compilation of country blues from the 30's, 40's, and 50's. What a perfect set for the times in which we are currently living! The guitar artistry is impeccable; the piano playing tinkles through the glum mood; the vocals smooth and real; the remastering is very clean and brings the music back to life.
