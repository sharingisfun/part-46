It was also only the third major fleet action between steel battleships following the battles of the Yellow Sea and Tsushima during the Russo-Japanese War. The only major fleet engagement of World War I, the Battle of Jutland has been surrounded by controversy ever since. The British public felt Admiral Jellicoe had failed - a reaction rooted in a hundred years of the 'Nelson cult', a conviction that anything short of a Trafalgar-style annihilation was letting the side down. On the 31st of May 1916 - 251 British and German battleships set out to annihilate one another in the North Sea. In a vicious engagement that lasted over 12 hours - 25 huge ships were sunk and 8,600 lives were lost. The German Fleet had sunk more ships and suffered fewer casualties, but the British had forced them to disengage and run for port and were still cruising off Denmark spoiling for a fight. This two-hour special tells the true story of the battle. An international team of marine divers and historians set out to explore the wrecks of the great Dreadnoughts that lie 100 miles from shore and up to 60 metres deep. The dives will at last reveal why the British navy failed to score a decisive victory.\n\nNarrated by Sean Pertwee\nExecutive Producer Hamish Barbour\nDirector Tony Bulley\nProducer Peter Jamieson\n\nA Dreadnought/Ideal World production for Channel 4 and the Discovery Channel (2004)\n\n\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2102 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x384\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.778:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 128kb/s CBR 44100 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 46:32.080\nNumber Of Parts: 2\nPart Size: 781,995,202 Bytes\nEncoded by: DocFreak08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:735b346aa6b8b299021acdfa0de7cfe3500ef3a9","amp;dn":"Channel4.Jutland.Clash.Of.The.Dreadnoughts.1of2.XviD.MP3.MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"735b346aa6b8b299021acdfa0de7cfe3500ef3a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,91,52,106,166,184,178,153,2,26,205,250,13,231,207,227,80,14,243,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
