COLLAPSE is the story of Michael Ruppert, former Los Angeles police officer turned rogue reporter whose eerie prediction of the current financial crisis shocked millions. Now Ruppert is warning of a new meltdown, one rooted in oil, economics, and covert U.S. policies that are leading us all towards unprecedented global disaster. \n\n\nIs he a prophet who can clearly see America s terrifying future, or a conspiracy theorist fueled by fear and paranoia? And if Ruppert is right, can this slide into catastrophe be stopped? Experience this sometimes harrowing, often poignant and always riveting look into the mind of the ultimate outsider from filmmaker Chris Smith, the award-winning director of American Movie and The Yes Men. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirected by: Chris Smith\n========================\n\n\nProduced by: Kate Noble\n=======================\n\n\nWritten by: Michael Ruppert\n===========================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    Collapse\nYear.................:    2009\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    01:20:45\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3) \nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9  \n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    624x352\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    1593 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    External English\nFile Size:...........:    919 MB\nFPS..................:    29.970000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2009\n\n\n\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1503769/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1503769/&lt;/a&gt;\n  \n  \n\n\n\nNote: External subtitles included.\n==================================\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\&quot;nfo\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                     ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD *****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\n=============\n\nAfter my account accidentally got deleted i had to restore it.However if you click on DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT link it might not work for you.Use the magnet link(s) on my older torrents instead,thank you.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad8fb1990f93ec7e7e318229072461032cd14d3e","amp;dn":"Collapse-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad8fb1990f93ec7e7e318229072461032cd14d3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,143,177,153,15,147,236,126,126,49,130,41,7,36,97,3,44,209,77,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
