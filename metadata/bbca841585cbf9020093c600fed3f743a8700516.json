Released at the height of the Summer of Love in 1967 the album also features the same backing band and production team that created Donovan's Sunshine Superman album. Filled with delightful and evocative dreamy, pop-psych and with the addition of ten bonus tracks. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbca841585cbf9020093c600fed3f743a8700516","amp;dn":"Picadilly+Line+-+The+Huge+World+of+Emily+Small+%281967%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbca841585cbf9020093c600fed3f743a8700516","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,202,132,21,133,203,249,2,0,147,198,0,254,211,247,67,168,112,5,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
