Her dad gets taken away from her at a young age by M. Bison who uses him in his criminal plot to overthrow Bangkok. Unfortunately for Bison Chun Li grows up, meets a mystic who teaches her some freaky stuff and sets out to kick his ass. While the Van Damme version was far from spectacular it had a sense of humor about itself and wasn't afraid to have fun with the material, which was at the very least entertaining for a lazy hour and a half. The Legend of Chun Li tries to be a dark brooding action thriller with something like Batman Begins as its model...but the material just doesn't support it. The plot goes back and forth between clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s and just plan dumb hokey sci-fi stuff. Yes, being &quot;rid of your goodness&quot; is actually a plot point. \n\nThe script is loaded with cheesy dialog and flat characters which doesn't make the actors' jobs any easier and they really don't live up to the challenge. Chris Klein is particularly bad in his attempt to be the bad ass.\n\nYou would think the action would at least make it worth the time but even that is nothing to brag about. The fights are far too staged and obviously fake. They throw in some signature moves from the video games that are beyond reality. If they'd been shot differently they would've been cool, but here they just look ridiculous. These are things that would fit at home in a more cartoony film like its predecessor...but sorry, no go. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24abbe9d353f571eb72a78aca2a0beede49b4b46","amp;dn":"StreeFighter+the+legend+of+Chun-li.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24abbe9d353f571eb72a78aca2a0beede49b4b46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,171,190,157,53,63,87,30,183,42,120,172,162,160,190,237,228,155,75,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
