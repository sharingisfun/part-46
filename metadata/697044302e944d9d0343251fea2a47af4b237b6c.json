We recognize that around 80% of the time spent tracking your time is on the core task of recording the time worked and so we have incorporated dozens of usability features to make this core task easy. Viewing, modifying and reporting previously recorded time, configuing users and other secondary tasks are conveniently accessed with a good balance between power and ease of use.\n\nTime tracking is the process of recording the time that you or employees work on various projects or tasks for your customers, your company, or yourself. Time tracking software automates this process by capturing the time electronically, providing a quick and conventient way to record, view, adjust and report time, reducing errors and the time and effort required when compared to manual recording methods.\n\nThere are two main uses for time tracking:\n1. Billable Hours. If you charge out time to customers then time tracking allows you to capture and report on all hours that can be billed to the customer.\n2. Project Analysis. If you work on or manage projects then time tracking provides transparency to the labor involved in completing the project and can show you exactly where the time is spent, by task, by staff member or by date. An analysis of actual time required to complete the various tasks in a project is extremely useful in improving future project estimations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:697044302e944d9d0343251fea2a47af4b237b6c","amp;dn":"Backslash+Complete+Time+Tracking+v2.54","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"697044302e944d9d0343251fea2a47af4b237b6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,112,68,48,46,148,77,157,3,67,37,31,234,42,71,175,75,35,123,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
