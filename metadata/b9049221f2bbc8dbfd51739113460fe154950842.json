It primarily addresses advanced students (including PhD students), but in a number of selected subject areas the reader is lead up to the frontiers of present research. Thus even the active scientist is addressed. This volume 1 provides the canonical knowledge in atomic physics together with basics of modern spectroscopy. Starting from the fundamentals of quantum physics, the reader is familiarized in well structured chapters step by step with the most important phenomena, models and measuring techniques. The emphasis is always on the experiment and its interpretation, while the necessary theory is introduced from this perspective in a compact and occasionally somewhat heuristic manner, easy to follow even for beginners","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9049221f2bbc8dbfd51739113460fe154950842","amp;dn":"Atoms%2C+Molecules+and+Optical+Physics+1%3A+Atoms+and+Spectroscopy+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9049221f2bbc8dbfd51739113460fe154950842","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,4,146,33,242,187,200,219,253,81,115,145,19,70,15,225,84,149,8,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
