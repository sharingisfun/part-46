RAR files can usually compress content by 8 percent to 15 percent more than ZIP files can. WinRAR is a powerful compression tool with many integrated additional functions to help you organize your compressed archives. It can backup your data and reduce size of email attachments, decompress RAR, ZIP and other files downloaded from Internet and create new archives in RAR and ZIP file format.\n\nWinRAR puts you ahead of the crowd when it comes to compression. By consistently creating smaller archives, WinRAR is often faster than the competition. This will save you disc space, transmission costs AND valuable working time as well. WinRAR is ideal for multimedia files. WinRAR automatically recognizes and selects the best compression method. The special compression algorithm compresses multimedia files, executables and object libraries\n\nFeatures of WinRAR:\n\n- Using WinRAR puts you ahead of the crowd when it comes to compression by consistently making smaller archives than the competition, saving disk space and transmission costs.\n- WinRAR provides complete support for RAR and ZIP archives and is able to unpack CAB, ARJ, LZH, TAR, GZ, ACE, UUE, BZ2, JAR, ISO, 7Z, Z archives.\n- WinRAR offers a graphic interactive interface utilizing mouse and menus as well as the command line interface.\n- WinRAR is easier to use than many other archivers with the inclusion of a special &quot;Wizard&quot; mode which allows instant access to the basic archiving functions through a simple question and answer procedure. This avoids confusion in the early stages of use.\n- WinRAR offers you the benefit of industry strength archive encryption using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a key of 128 bits.\n- WinRAR supports files and archives up to 8,589 billion gigabytes in size. The number of archived files is, for all practical purposes, unlimited.\n- WinRAR offers the ability to create selfextracting and multivolume archives.\nRecovery record and recovery volumes allow to reconstruct even physically damaged archives.\n- WinRAR features are constantly being developed to keep WinRAR ahead of the pack.\n\n\n\n\nWhat's new in Version 5.10 beta 3\n\n\n1. More efficient implementation of &quot;Keep broken files&quot; extraction\noption (-kb switch in command line mode). Now it allows to recover\nmore data from file split between RAR volumes if next volume\nis missing.\n\n2. Bugs fixed:\n\na) &quot;Create recovery volumes&quot; command on &quot;Options&quot; page of archive\ninformation dialog was inaccessible if &quot;Merge volume contents&quot;\noption was enabled in WinRAR settings;\n\nb) if wrong password was entered for RAR archive with encrypted\nfile names, previous beta applied such wrong password\nautomatically, when opening the same archive again.\n\n\nSupported OS:\n\nWindows 7/8/vista/xp\n\n\nHomepage: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rarlab.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rarlab.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nInstall Notes:\n\n1] Install the app.\n\n2] Copy the file 'RarReg.key' to directory C:/Programe file/WinRaR. \n\n\nDone you got the full version....\n\n\n\nTested And Working...\nScanned (With Kaspersky) And 100% Clean.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10bf3749cef383db2c064e5879c773fb8b8e3a54","amp;dn":"WinRAR+x64+%2864+bit%29+5.10+beta+3%2BKey+%7BTeam+EAT%7D+%28Alien%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10bf3749cef383db2c064e5879c773fb8b8e3a54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,191,55,73,206,243,131,219,44,6,78,88,121,199,115,251,139,142,58,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
