He worked the streets for food and warmth, certain that one day his life would take a better path. That day arrived in the form of a flyer smacking him in the face after enduring a particularly rough trick. Walking through the front door of the Pride safe house became the best decision Skylar ever made. He began a new life with help from billionaire businessman Caden Fournier, his husband, Kellan, and their outreach center associates. That life also included a handsome, six-foot-two Italian who looked mighty fine astride a Harley. After a tense introduction, Skylar discovered Justice Salvatore was unlike any man he'd ever met. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about to find out just how different Justice is. The two grow closer as Skylar struggles with his own weirdÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ ability. Just when he dares to dream of a happy ending, his past explodes into his present and threatens to destroy everything. \n\nJustice Salvatore has only been in love once, with the beautiful daughter of his werewolf packÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beta. She was human, however, and Justice stayed away to protect her Ã¢â‚¬â€ only to mourn her death from a rogue attack. Skylar Foxx is stunning, but Justice is swept away by his incredible voice. Smitten on the spot, he sets his sights on getting to know the skittish young man. Bad things are happening to Skylar as they grow close, and Justice will do everything in his power to protect him. A terrifying secret shakes Justice to his core, and he is forced to decide whether someone close to him will live or die. After the hell Skylar has been through, Justice makes the only choice. \n\nThere will be justice for Skylar.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f668c303b9b4eb90aff67eb087bed80d11e0baf","amp;dn":"Sandrine+Gasq-Dion+%26amp%3B+Jennifer+%27Jenjo%27+Jacobson+-+Justice+For","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f668c303b9b4eb90aff67eb087bed80d11e0baf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,102,140,48,59,155,78,185,10,255,103,235,8,123,237,128,209,30,11,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
