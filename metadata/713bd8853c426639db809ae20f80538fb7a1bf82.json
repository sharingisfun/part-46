Having killed all the men and children, and having their way with the women, then killing them as well, they begin to leave for the New World. But the town wise man, thought dead, places a curse on them. &quot;Though you sail for a thousand years, O Norsemen,&quot; says the old man, &quot;You shall not reach the land you seek.&quot; After sailing the seas for 1000 years, then they finally land in New York.
