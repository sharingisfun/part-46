They released one major label album in 1992 called The Silent Majority. Two of their songs appeared on the Beavis &amp; Butthead TV Show, &quot;Tank&quot; and &quot;School's For Fools&quot;. They were known for the antics of their lead singer Stanley (aka Chris Stann), who dressed in dirty clothes and wandered around the audience before gigs, mumbling incoherently. A popular rumor was that he was a homeless man who the band had recruited to sing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:302128e77b34d91e01e37fce14a03f535f27b3dd","amp;dn":"Life%2C+Sex+and+Death+-+The+Silent+Majority+%281992%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"302128e77b34d91e01e37fce14a03f535f27b3dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,33,40,231,123,52,217,30,1,227,127,206,20,160,63,83,95,39,179,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
