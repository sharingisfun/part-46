Her overbearing mother Ellen constantly attempts to set Gwen up with the sons of her friends. But between work, online studies and raising her precocious 7-year-old son Alex, Gwen doesn't think she has time to find &quot;Mr. Right.&quot; That is until handsome, charming and successful Ed Baker jogs into her life and makes her think perhaps there is room for love. Gwen's hopes for happily ever after crumble when Gwen discovers Ed is not only married with kids... but also the preacher of a popular church. When Ed's heiress wife is murdered, Gwen find herself in the middle of a police investigation that forces her to face skeletons from her past, and fight for her freedom and custody of her son.\n\n\nCast: \n\nSarah Lancaster ...
