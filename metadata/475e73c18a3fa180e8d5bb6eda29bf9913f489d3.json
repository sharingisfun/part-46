Somebody is playing the railroads like a giant train set, causing high-speed derailments that strew the rails with headless victims from coast to coast. And could the repeated sightings of a ghostly samurai swordsman be fact or mass hysteria?\n \nAs the carnage continues unchecked and the body count mounts, Dr. Harold Smith suspects the train terror is merely a decoy for the real target. He sends Remo Williams and Master Chiun to ride the rails, posing as investigators for the Department of TransportationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½clearly an equal-opportunity employer who won't discriminate against aging Asians. And now Chiun and Remo get equal opportunity to literally lose their heads over an old enemy.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:475e73c18a3fa180e8d5bb6eda29bf9913f489d3","amp;dn":"the+DESTROYER+103%3A+Engines+of+Destruction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"475e73c18a3fa180e8d5bb6eda29bf9913f489d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,94,115,193,138,63,161,128,232,213,187,110,218,41,191,153,19,244,137,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
