In the Ninth Edition, Trigonometry: A Unit Circle Approach has evolved to meet todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s course needs, building on these hallmarks by integrating projects and other interactive learning tools for use in the classroom or online.\nFrom the Publisher\nA proven motivator for students of diverse mathematical backgrounds, this text is organized and written with all students in mind. Striving to teach mathematics as a way of life, Sullivan provides understandable, realistic applications that are consistent with the abilities of any student. This text develops the trigonometric functions using a unit circl approach and showing how it leads to the right triangle approach. Graphing techniques are emphasized, including a thorough discussion of polar coordinates, parametric equations, and conics using polar coordinates. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 720 pages\n    * Publisher: Addison Wesley; 9 edition (March 19, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0321716574\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0321716576","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcafc7b6c49679723d4b91492412cc0fe2dd8605","amp;dn":"Trigononometry+-+A+Unit+Circle+Approach+9th+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcafc7b6c49679723d4b91492412cc0fe2dd8605","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,175,199,182,196,150,121,114,61,75,145,73,36,18,204,15,226,221,134,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
