Produced by the Brits Jon Astley and Phil Chapman, they released the album Ã¢â‚¬Å“Gotta MoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in 1980. Although that album was well-received, problems with the label prompted two members to leave the band. Diamond and Burke-Gaffney searched for replacements and in came McGovern and Boisvenue. \n\nOrphan was born and they signed a record deal with CBS in Canada and Portrait in the US. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lonely At NightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (1983) was recorded at the famous Power Station studios in New York and produced by none other than Lance Quinn and Tony Bongiovi. \n\nExtensive touring followed until the band began to work on a follow-up, this time under the guidance of the aforementioned Astley and Chapman again. Also back in the line-up was original Pumps drummer Terry Norman Taylor. Although Ã¢â‚¬Å“SaluteÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (1985) was a worthy follow-up to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lonely At NightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, musical trends began to change and the band folded shortly after. \n\nLucky for us, Escape Music have now re-issued both albums as a brilliant 2 in 1 digipak, including a 12-page booklet in which you can find the story of the band in a nutshell as well as all the lyrics and credits. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBand:\n\nChris Burke-Gaffney: Lead Vocals, Bass Guitar\n\nSteve McGovern: Guitars Ans Vocals\n\nBrent Diamond: Keyboards And Vocals\n\nTerry Norman Taylor: Drums, Percussion, Vocals \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c220804283618d7fda4f48899f19041960a31404","amp;dn":"Orphan+-+Lonely+At+Night+%2F+Salute+%5B1983%2F1985%5D%5B2003%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c220804283618d7fda4f48899f19041960a31404","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,32,128,66,131,97,141,127,218,79,72,137,159,25,4,25,96,163,20,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
