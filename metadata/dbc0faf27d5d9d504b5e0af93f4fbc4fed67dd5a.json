This collects all the material from the LPs &quot;An Evening With Dando Shaft&quot; (1970), &quot;Dando Shaft&quot; (1971), and &quot;Lantaloon,&quot; from 1972, along with a few added outtakes and rarities. The musical calibre and adventurousness on all three albums was quite high: at a time when many of their hippie contemporaries were groping in the dark (both literally and figuratively...) the members of Dando Shaft were quite solid in their musical abilities and conceptual/compositional structure. Their original material was marked by jazzy, dancing mandolin work, hearty trad-folk vocals and a touch of loping Balkan melodies, the group sounded quite accomplished and assured, and yet loose and limber enough to be kinda fun as well... and still as fresh sounding today as it was back then! Fans of contemporary acts such as The Incredible String Band, Pentangle and Planxty owe it to themselves to check this one out.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbc0faf27d5d9d504b5e0af93f4fbc4fed67dd5a","amp;dn":"Dando+Shaft...Anthology%282002%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbc0faf27d5d9d504b5e0af93f4fbc4fed67dd5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,192,250,242,125,93,157,80,75,94,10,249,63,79,188,79,237,103,221,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
