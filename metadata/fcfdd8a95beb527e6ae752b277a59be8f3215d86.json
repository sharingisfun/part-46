Which sorts of films make the cut and why? Movie Greats questions how cinema is ranked and, in doing so, uncovers a history of critical conflict, with different aesthetic positions battling for dominance.\n\nThe films examined range across the history of cinema: The Battleship Potemkin, The 39 Steps, Modern Times, Citizen Kane, It's a Wonderful Life, Black Narcissus, The Night of the Hunter, Lawrence of Arabia, 8 1/2, 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Godfather, Raging Bull, The Piano and Kill Bill: Vol. 1.\n\nEach chapter opens with a brief summary of the filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s plot and goes on to discuss the historical context, the key individuals who made the film, and initial and subsequent popular and critical responses.\n\nStudents studying the history of film, canon formation or film aesthetics will find this book relevant, provocative and absorbing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcfdd8a95beb527e6ae752b277a59be8f3215d86","amp;dn":"Movie+Greats+-+A+Critical+Study+of+Classic+Cinema+2008+%28Malestro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcfdd8a95beb527e6ae752b277a59be8f3215d86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,253,216,169,91,235,82,126,106,231,82,178,119,165,155,232,243,33,93,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
