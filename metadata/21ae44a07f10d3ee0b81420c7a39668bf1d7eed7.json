Every night, the same number of beasts. The two men conclude that there's a connection to their Israeli Army mission in the first Lebanon War of the early eighties. Ari is surprised that he can't remember a thing anymore about that period of his life. Intrigued by this riddle, he decides to meet and interview old friends and comrades around the world. He needs to discover the truth about that time and about himself. As Ari delves deeper and deeper into the mystery, his memory begins to creep up in surreal images.\n\nThis DVDRip was just released earlier today, and I downloaded it, but the file was named in such a way I had no idea, so I had to start watching it just to figure out what it was. Then an hour and a half went by and I'm seeing the ending and finally the title comes up with the subtitles ... honestly, this film is a bit more than poignant considering what is going on right now in Gaza ...\n\nBut even if you're not really into the politics and the current events, I think most people will like the semi-releastic animation and the great use of color in this film. It's definitely worth the download! Enjoy!\n\nWARNING: This may be animation, but it is NOT for little kids. This film is rated &quot;R&quot; in the United States for some pretty disturbing imagery of war and also for nudity and sexual content. Don't download this thinking it looks like a great film for your kids ... it's not!!\n\nScreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/bashir1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/bashir1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/bashir2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/bashir2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/bashir3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/bashir3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/bashir4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/bashir4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/bashir5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/bashir5.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdditional Info\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike all my iPod torrents, these files have their ID3 tags preformatted for your ease!
