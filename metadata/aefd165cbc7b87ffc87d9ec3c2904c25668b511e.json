ID3v2  Tagged ...\n\n\nWe are truly into the age of chaos, long in the planning and written about\nopenly by the big movers and shakers who lord over us. Some of them, such\nas Brzezinski have described the coming effects on world-wide societies as\nakin to the vast population movements which occurred at the beginning of\nthe industrial revolution.\n\nAfter the unification of Europe was to follow the unification of the Americas\nwith the resulting clash of cultures and the initial mayhem produced. People\nslept while the Free Trade Agreement and the subsequent NAFTA (North American\nFree Trade Agreement) were discussed with deliberate minimum coverage by the\nCFR (Council on Foreign Relations) controlled media.\n\nFor those who wish to check, the publicly available censored version will see\nit has to do, in part, with THE FREE FLOW OF GOODS AND LABOR across traditional\nnational boundaries People are being encouraged to blame the effect (mass influx\nfrom south) and to completely forget the cause. Out of the mayhem will materialize,\nas if by magic, a new Constitution of the Americas. This will be presented as\nthe only reasonable and logical direction to go if we are all to live in\npeace and security.\n\nCoupled with this will come the announcement that every citizen of the Americas\nmust accept an INTERNATIONAL Identity Card under the guise that authorities will\nbe able to track criminal elements moving northwards. The problem has been caused,\nthe reaction is underway, and the solution will be presented. This is the standard\nHegelian technique which never fails.\n\nRead &quot;MILLENNIUM - Winners and Losers in the Coming World Order&quot; by Jacques Attali\nwho helped spearhead the European Union.\n\nAlan Watt\n\n\n\nAlan Watt, a leading researcher into hidden history, ancient civilizations,\nand their influence on modern society, speaks on the global agenda of the\nruling elite, the open conspiracy, the old world order made new, the temporary\npolice state leading to the chip implant, and much more.\n\nAlan Watt&amp;#039;s interviews on CuttingThroughTheMatrix are absolutely priceless.\nHis broadcasts are in a class of their own.\nListen to them all at:\n\t\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cuttingthroughthematrix.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cuttingthroughthematrix.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nIn all ages, in all lands, there have been those who seek truth. This seeking\nis an individual&amp;#039;s search for something more than self, and much more than the\nconfines of this worldly system. It is the seeker, who understands there is more\nthan what meets the eye, who is not afraid and makes the choice to go into the\nunknown. The process of awaking has begun, the discovery is underway.\n\n2008 - Alan Watt - A Course in Deprogramming\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis Week: week 39, 2008\n\n1.
