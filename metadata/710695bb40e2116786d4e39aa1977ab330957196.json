Not that this is the chameleon's swan song, but it's a fitting time for him to speak out honestly about his life--a life that's been lionized, criticized, and mythologized by the masses for three decades. Bowie's Hunky Dory muses were once &quot;driving their mamas and papas insane,&quot; but here they are aged and faded (&quot;The Pretty Things Are Going to Hell&quot;); yet the man himself could not be more graceful or vibrant.\n\n\n\n\nInfo: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Hours-David-Bowie/dp/B00001QGPR&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Hours-David-Bowie/dp/B00001QGPR&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:710695bb40e2116786d4e39aa1977ab330957196","amp;dn":"David+Bowie+-+Hours+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"710695bb40e2116786d4e39aa1977ab330957196","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,6,149,187,64,226,17,103,134,212,227,154,161,151,122,179,48,149,113,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
