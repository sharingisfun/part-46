When Soapie reveals a long-hidden secret, Rosie wonders if she has to let go of her fears, and trust that the big-hearted, messy life that awaits her just may be the one she was meant to live.\n\nReview\n\nEssay by Maddie Dawson\n\nAs a writer, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m always thrilled when a character shows up in my head, demanding that I write a story about her. (Mostly itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s women who initially come knocking at my brainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s door, but IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve noticed that they quickly bring along some men, usually the men who are giving them the troubles they need me to write down.)\n\nIt was no different when Rosie Kelley showed up one night. She woke me up to tell me that she was forty-four years old, she was pretty sure she was pregnant for the first time, and the grandmother who raised her might be dying, and she was breaking up with the guy who got her pregnant because he wanted to move across countryÃ¢â‚¬â€and well, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d just realized she wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ready to move away with a man who was perhaps a little bit selfish. (Maybe a lot selfish!) News like this makes me bolt upright in the bed and go off looking for my laptop. The sun was just coming up as I typed up the complicated facts of RosieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life: an orphan, unmarried, never really lived the life she wanted, 15-year relationship with a nerdy man who collects teacupsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and on and on.\n\nBelieve me, I wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have gotten up if sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d just been one of those whiny types. I hate whiners! Over the next few days, I discovered she was funny and irreverent and completely unprepared for the life that had just reached up and chosen her. She had depth and empathy and also she was scared out of her mind, which always fascinates me about people.\n\nI quickly decided I knew how things were going to turn out in this book. I went to work every day, typing up the story, weaving in subplots that showed up, (thank you, subplots), and enjoying the details of RosieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s agonies and ecstasies. I had sex scenes and food scenes and people dancing in the living room and cheating at Scrabble and fighting and making upÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and then one day I got close to the end of the book and the bottom fell out.\n\nRosie refused to do what I thought she and I had agreed that she would do. It wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work, she said. It would, I told her.\n\nAnd then she said: No way.\n\nMy friends argued with me, pointing out that it was MY book, that Rosie wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢tÃ¢â‚¬â€you know, really realÃ¢â‚¬â€and urging me to write the book the way I thought it should be. So I tried that, and it didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work. Fell flat.\n\nI guess the point is that you breathe life into these characters who show up and agree to talk to you, and thenÃ¢â‚¬â€just like with the real humans you raisedÃ¢â‚¬â€there comes a time when you have to listen to them. We read to be intrigued, delighted, and to find out what happens nextÃ¢â‚¬â€and sometimes, it turns out, writers are just as surprised as readers by what our characters decide to do.\n\nFrom Booklist\n\nRosie and Jonathan, lovers and partners for more than 15 years, get engaged, pack up to move to California for JonathanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new job, then break up, all within the first 100 pages of DawsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s novel. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a relief because self-centered Jonathan is such an unlikable character, and the change clears the way for Rosie, who finds herself pregnant at 44 with JonathanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s child. Soapie, RosieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cantankerous grandmother, is beginning to decline, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hired Tony, a young man who mixes her Bloody Marys and appears at first to be a gigolo. Rosie moves back with Soapie to check up on her and her new Ã¢â‚¬Å“hired help,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ finding that Soapie also has the daily attention of George, a married friend whose wife has dementia, and that Tony is a actually a warm family guy. Together, the four misfits play games, sing, and dance, creating a Ã¢â‚¬Å“sweetness that comes when something canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be permanent: it comes attached to an ache.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Dawson keeps readers turning the pages to find out who Rosie will choose in the end. --Laurie Borman","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c05ceb26cad87049075266430214ef8ffab53d91","amp;dn":"The+Opposite+of+Maybe+-+Maddie+Dawson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c05ceb26cad87049075266430214ef8ffab53d91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,92,235,38,202,216,112,73,7,82,102,67,2,20,239,143,250,181,61,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
