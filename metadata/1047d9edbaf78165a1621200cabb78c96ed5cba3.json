It is definitely an ideal solution when shopping for gifts, cleansing the system after someone else has used it, or when preparing to sell your computer. Ensure your personal information is out of reach.\n\nMacCleanse also contains enhanced features for specific applications like Acquisition, Adium, AIM, aMSN, Azureus, Bit Torrent, Colloquy, FireFox 2 &amp; 3, iCab, iChat, ICQ, Internet Explorer, Mozilla, MPlayer, MSN Messenger, Netscape, OmniWeb, Opera, Preview, QuickTime, Safari, Skype, Transmission, Unison, Xtorrent, and Yahoo Messenger.
