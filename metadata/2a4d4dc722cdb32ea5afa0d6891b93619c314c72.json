It's\nsimilar in style and scope to YS: lots of great technical articles with\nsome gaming content. It was published seemingly erratically at first,\nbefore settling down to a monthly schedule in 1985 before being absorbed\ninto &quot;Your Commodore&quot;.\n\nThese PDFs are the complied collections of page scans already available.\nThey've been OCR'd to allow text searching and copying - this should\nprove very useful for the retro archivist who'd like to have their own\nlocal searchable archive. They look great on most PDF readers, including\nthe iPad.\n\nThe OCR software has done it's best, but has struggled with some of the\nmore unusual fonts and layouts used. Also, paragraph formatting is a bit\nrandom at best.\n\nMore OCR'd scans will be periodically available - please check\nretropdfswordpresscom for more information.\n\nThanks to Martijn van der Heide for the wonderful World Of Spectrum site\n(wwwworldofspectrumorg), and ADJB and everyone else on the WoS forums\nfor help and advice.\n\n90's style &quot;greets&quot; to anyone formally or currently involved in the\nAmiga scene, especially Pazza, Mic Flair, Violator, Denzil, Tango, Fat\nWill, mUb, Johann and Maximan, and anyone else who read or wrote for LSD\nGrapevine.
