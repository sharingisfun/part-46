Moving around, long before slavery was invented. Dancing around in his native African suit (with feather) and less offensive than Father Christmas, reducing Christmas (the day we celebrate the birth of Jesus), to money and consumption. In Holland we are angry about the stupid comments by an (important?) VN lady (with obviously still some issues) about our National children's party. Sinterklaas is simply first (and quite another person than our imaginary Grandfather) and stays. Together with our friends... Enjoying some Indie in the meantime.\n\n\n~@~ Indie 1312 I2 In The Dark (Easy Rock)\n\n 01 James Blunt - Telephone\n 02 The Head &amp; The Heart - Josh Mcbride\n 03 I Said Yes - Five Guitar Song\n 04 Benin City - Wha Gwan\n 05 Radical Face - Holy Branches\n 06 Shinedown - Through The Ghost\n 07 MÃ¢â‚¬Âº Ft.
