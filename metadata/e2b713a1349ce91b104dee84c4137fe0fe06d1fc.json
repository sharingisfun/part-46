Yet critical software projects consistently come in late, defective, and way over budget. So whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the problem?\n\nGet ready for a shock, because the answer to the problem is to avoid reality altogether. A new IT practice and technology called Service Virtualization (SV) is industrializing the process of simulating everything in our software development and test environments. Yes, fake systems are even better than the real thing for most of the design and development lifecycle, and SV is already making a huge impact at some of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest companies.\n\nFor more information, see servicevirtualization.com.\n\nWho this book is for\nThis book is not only for IT practitioners on engineering, testing, and environments teams engaged in the development and delivery of enterprise software, but also for executives of companies in all sectors who need to understand and implement emergent opportunities to improve the time to market and overall competitiveness of any outward-facing business strategy that has a software application component.\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1.
