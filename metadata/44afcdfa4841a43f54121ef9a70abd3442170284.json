As research for his latest book, Enslin is determined to check out the notorious room 1408 in a New York City hotel by personally staying as a guest in the fabled room. He believes that 1408 is just a myth perpetuated by stories and rumors that Enslin has collected for his past works. However, hotel manager Mr. Olin has strong objections to Enslin&amp;#039;s stay and only warns him of possible danger to come. Enslin is determined to go anyway. But what Mike Enslin is about to experience is no myth, as 1408 truly is a room where the guests don&amp;#039;t check out by noon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44afcdfa4841a43f54121ef9a70abd3442170284","amp;dn":"1408+%282007%29+Theatrical+%26+Directors+Cut+PAL+DVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44afcdfa4841a43f54121ef9a70abd3442170284","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,175,205,250,72,65,164,63,84,18,30,249,167,10,189,52,66,23,2,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
