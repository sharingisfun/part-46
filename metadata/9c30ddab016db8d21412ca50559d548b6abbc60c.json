The film focuses on the torrid and manipulative relationships among three characters. As the story progresses, each of their secrets, lies and hidden agendas are exposed. Themes of seduction, deception, exploitation and control shift and accelerate to a delerious climax. \n\nOriginally called [b]11 Days with Ivan[/b], the film was cut down from its 2 hour 10 minute running time to a brisk 75 minutes, effectively cutting 4 days out of the original. The result: a faster-paced narrative and a riveting character study. \n\nSynopsis: Al, a sensitive, reclusive Canadian Artist living in a remote cottage, is visited by Ivan, a boisterous, erratic, ambitious American friend from college, accompanied by his new wife, Sienna, a beautiful and mysterious woman. Ivan and Sienna urge Al to sell his cottage and invest as a partner in their trading business. They progressively seduce, manipulate, deceive and terrorize Al, who falls in love with Sienna, sending Ivan into fits of violent jealous rage. But through these explosive enounters, and among the expanding and complex web of malicious lies and mischief are sincere truths and half-truths, passion and desperation, love and madness. \n\n\nThe Cast:  \nAL: Shane Snipes \nSIENNA: Linda Dargavel \nIVAN: Matt Miller \nAL'S SISTER: Anastasia Kimmett \nSCORPIO: Dan McNeil \nDEAD ENDER: Natalie Tremblay \n\n\nThe Crew: \nWriter, Producer, Director, Camera: Vincent Lauzon \nUnit Production Manager, Gaffer, Additional Camera: John Roberston \nSound Recording, Lights, Camera Rigging, Stills: Laszlo Szijarto \nSet Constr uction: Matt Miller, Laszlo Szijarto \nScript Supervisor, Production Assistant, Make-up: Maxime Thomas \nProduction Assistants: Matt Miller, Michael Kennedy \nCook: Gabor Zsigovics \nEditor: Vincent Lauzon \n\n\nThe Music: \n\nCasey Comeau and The Halfmilers  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.caseycomeau.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.caseycomeau.com/&lt;/a&gt; \n&quot;Munly&quot; \n&quot;Smow Creatures&quot; \n&quot;Day That He Died&quot; \n\nGood2Go  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://good2gomusic.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://good2gomusic.com/&lt;/a&gt; \n&quot;Mind the Net&quot; \n&quot;Boots&quot; \n\nAbolishment  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://abolishment.cjb.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://abolishment.cjb.net/&lt;/a&gt; \n&quot;Primitive Years&quot;\n&quot;Salvation Denied&quot;\n \nNaked i  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nakedi.ca/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nakedi.ca/&lt;/a&gt; \n&quot;Laisse-moi t'aimer&quot; \n&quot;Painted Rainbows&quot; \n\n\nMore info: http://borderlinefilms.net/11days.htm \nTrailer: http://borderlinefilms.net/11days/11DaysWebTrailer.wmv \n\n\nAVI File Details\nName.........: 7 Days with Ivan [2007-Vincent Lauzon].avi\nFilesize.....: 956 MB \nRuntime......: 01:15:32 (135,832 fr)\nVideo Codec..: DivX 5.0\nVideo Bitrate: 1571 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 kb/s (96/ch, stereo) CBR \nFrame Size...: 800x448 (1.79:1) [=25:14]\n\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: external, English\nContents: Main movie, subtitles, and deleted scene","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c30ddab016db8d21412ca50559d548b6abbc60c","amp;dn":"7+Days+with+Ivan+%5B2007%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c30ddab016db8d21412ca50559d548b6abbc60c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,48,221,171,1,109,184,210,20,18,202,80,85,157,84,139,106,187,198,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
