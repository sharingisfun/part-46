The west has not yet come to terms with it's fading supremacy. At the end of every empire, under the guise of renewal, tribes, armies and organizations appear and devour the heritage of the former superpower--often from within. \r\n\r\nIn his writings on the fate of empires, the soldier, diplomat and traveler, Lt.
