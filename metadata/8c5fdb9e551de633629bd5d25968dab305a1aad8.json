But, they know that there is something more. There is some idea, some mechanism, some accidental side effect that is standing between them and a pure leap of innovation. And so, through trial and error they are building the device that is missing most. However, two of these men find the device and immediately realize that it is too valuable to market. The limit of their trust in each other is strained when they are faced with the question, If you always want what you can't have, what do you want when you can have anything?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c5fdb9e551de633629bd5d25968dab305a1aad8","amp;dn":"Primer+2004+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c5fdb9e551de633629bd5d25968dab305a1aad8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,95,219,158,85,29,230,51,98,155,213,210,89,104,218,179,5,161,170,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
