Jeff plays a stranger from the Midwest who arrives in Hollywood, rents a motel room, and becomes the major fantasy of the owner, his mother and all the other guests. Young and old, male and female, black and white: everybody finds him delectable. In the end, they invite him for a Christmas dinner..... \n\n\n Jeff Stryker ...

ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be surprised if we reach 100 by the end of the year,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ mused Regina Ziegler. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMaybe we should register the film in the Guinness Book of Records!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \nThat cordial, lasting, mutually esteemed relationship between producer Regina Ziegler and writer-director Rosa von Praunheim goes back three decades - to when Regina assisted Rosa (alias Holger Mischwitzki) on one of the comic cult classics of the New German Cinema movement: Die Bettwurst (1970). Starring RosaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fabulous ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAunt LuciÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Kryn and the inimitable Dietmar Kracht, the film proved so popular that it prompted an immediate sequel, Berliner Bettwurst (1973), and might have hatched a series had not Dietmar tried to swim Lake Havel one luminous evening. No matter - Can I Be Your Bratwurst, Please? bears all the earmarks of a consummated trilogy: a kinky, ribald, diverting, hilarious Erotic Tale. And not a moment too soon, for it was the last screen appearance of the nonagenarian Luci Kryn. \nShot at the fabled Highland Gardens in Hollywood, and starring gay porn star Jeff Stryker in his first full-fledged acting role, Bratwurst confirms Praunheim as a gifted storyteller with a light hand for comic twists, a flair for amusing character portrayals, and a pronounced talent for situational theatrics that walk the fine line between the absolutely absurd and the positively preposterous. As one observant critic remarked, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s never been a Christmas dinner quite like this one before!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\nRosa von Praunheim - Director \nRosa von Praunheim was born in Riga, Latvia in 1942. He studied painting in Berlin and took his artistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s name of Rosa von Praunheim in 1964; partly in reference to the pink triangle homosexuals were forced to wear in the Nazi concentration camps. Rosa is a well-known gay who has made over 50 films as the enfant terrible of the New German Cinema. \n\ndirector | Rosa von Praunheim script | Rosa von Praunheim, Lawrence Elbert editor | Rosa von Praunheim, Lorenz Haarmann art director | Arnie Saiko music | Alan Ari Lazar camera | Lorenz Haarmann executive producer | Regina Ziegler co-Producer | WDR Schauspieler: Jeff Stryker, Luzy Kryn, Karl-Heinz Teuber, Sirena Irwin, Selene Luna, Vaginal Davis, | tv editor | Karin Zahn, WDR sound | Dolby SR series | EROTIC TALES length | 29 min. date of broadcasting | nn channel | WDR award | TEAM AWARD, Stuttgarter Filmwinter 2001, Germany format | 35 mm, colour; 1:1,85 language | English genre | Short Feature \n\n\nEmbrace the absurd camp of director Rosa von Prauheim's surreal comedy of sexual (and other) desires and you can't help but be charmed. Just don't expect gay porn star Jeff Stryker to actually act any better than your average adult film thespian, and don't be put off by the lingering shots of Stryker's, uh, striker. When Stryker moves into a Hollywood hotel run by a fey German hypnotist, each of the bizarre collection of residents has her or his own fantasy about the buff boy toy. In the end, all of their hungers are satisfied - and how. Watching the antics of 90-something Luci Kryn unabashedly reading her lines from off-screen cue cards is a special treat, especially given that this was her last film role. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:949718072d9c28653e82af79ff81c5b26b6545a7","amp;dn":"Can+I+Be+Your+Bratwurst%2C+Please+%5B1999%5D+with+Jeff+Stryker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"949718072d9c28653e82af79ff81c5b26b6545a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,151,24,7,45,156,40,101,62,130,175,121,255,129,197,178,107,101,69,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
