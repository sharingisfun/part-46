Before the song's end, the rain stops and the clouds begin to clear. Dave tells the audience that he had hoped the rain would stop so they could see some satellites and the band then launches into a notable version of Satellite. Additional highlights include Angel From Montgomery with Boyd singing lead and All Along the Watchtower which features a quiet interlude that sounds like distant thunder. Watchtower comes screaming back in full force with LeRoi's saxophone.\n\n01 One Sweet World\t9:52\n02 Satellite\t5:19\t\n03 Tripping Billies\t5:16\n04 Rhyme and Reason\t5:50\n05 Dancing Nancies\t9:18\n06 Lie In Our Graves\t6:40\n07 Warehouse\t8:13\n08 Pay for What You Get\t7:02\n09 Jimi Thing\t13:23\n10 True Reflections\t7:25\n11 Ants Marching\t6:43\n12 Angel From Montgomery\t5:53\n13 All Along the Watchtower\t12:28","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e776be9d93721de3500eb99f5b7b34f7e3179bb5","amp;dn":"Dave+Matthews+Band+-+LIVE+07%2F20%2F1995+%5B320k+MP3%5D+Memphis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e776be9d93721de3500eb99f5b7b34f7e3179bb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,118,190,157,147,114,29,227,80,14,185,159,91,123,52,247,227,23,155,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
