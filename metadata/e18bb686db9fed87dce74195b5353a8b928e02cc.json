That's what happened when I came across this DVD.  It is a disc the Musicland Group used to send to their affiliate stores (Sam Goody, Media Play, On Cue, etc.), to play on in-store TV's to promote new releases once a month.  Usually when the new month arrives, the previous month's disc is either sent back to headquarters or destroyed.  Luckily for all of us this DVD received neither fate, and I was glad I found it!!\n\nThis DVD is full of excellent videos, several I searched for on TPB and did not find.  Instead of trying to rip each video separately, I made a ISO image of the near mint DVD.  The videos contained herein are as follows in order of appearance (when you select the On Cue tab on the menu)\n\nSomeone To Call My Lover - Janet Jackson\nRockin' The Suburbs - Ben Folds\nStart The Commotion (Zoolander Theme) - Wiseguys (featuring Greg Nice)\nSurvivor - Destiny's Child\nAustin - Blake Shelton\nFamily Affair - Mary J.
