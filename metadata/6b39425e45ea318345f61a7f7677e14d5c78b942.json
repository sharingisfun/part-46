You are very careful and good, so you preserve the seed. I destroy the seed and make it into a tree.&quot;\n- Sadhguru\n\nIn Sacred Seed, Sadhguru deals with moving on from mere survival that all life forms are capable of, to spiritual flowering - the highest possibility offered only to a human being, achieved through the journey inward.\n\nQuestion: Sadhguru a pupil asked, &quot;Is it best for me master, to walk the straight path or would it be better for me to choose the crooked path, on which my spirit leads me?&quot; The master replied, &quot;He who takes the straight path North sees the North; he who takes the straight path South sees the South; he who takes the straight path East sees the East; he who takes the straight path West sees the West; and he who walks the crooked path, sees all the directions.&quot; Please comment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b39425e45ea318345f61a7f7677e14d5c78b942","amp;dn":"Sacred+Seed--Sadhguru+Jaggi+Vasudev","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b39425e45ea318345f61a7f7677e14d5c78b942","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,57,66,94,69,234,49,131,69,246,26,127,118,119,225,77,92,120,185,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
