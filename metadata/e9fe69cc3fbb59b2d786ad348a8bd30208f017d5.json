I'm unclear on why this wasn't re-released as an issue in its own right; that's how they did it for previous DHP spin-outs such as &quot;Amala's Blade&quot; and &quot;Black Beetle&quot;, but no matter.\n\nThe only real downside here is that the artwork wasn't featured on any of the DHP covers, so I had to improvise and use one of Geof Darrow's splash pieces for a bookend instead. But there's no such thing as too much Darrow, so it's all good! :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9fe69cc3fbb59b2d786ad348a8bd30208f017d5","amp;dn":"Brain+Boy+0+%28from+DHP+23-25%7C2013%7CDgtl-1680%7CSon+of+Ultron-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9fe69cc3fbb59b2d786ad348a8bd30208f017d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,254,105,204,63,187,89,178,215,134,173,52,138,139,211,2,8,240,23,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
