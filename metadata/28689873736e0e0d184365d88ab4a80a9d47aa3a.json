Neither group challenged the other's right to use the name (as usually happens in such cases) so each is known as the Spinners in their home country. To avoid confusing anybody, I will refer to this group as the (British) Spinners.\nFolk music purists often ignore the (British) Spinners but their easy-going style attracted a lot of people into folk music. Tony Davis (banjo, tin whistle, guitar, kazoo), Mick Groves (guitar), Hughie Jones (guitar, harmonica, banjo) and Cliff Hall (guitar, harmonica) were the group's members although John McCormick (double bass) often performed live with them.\n\nThis compilation provides a good sample of their music, which includes covers of traditional folk songs such as Banks of the Ohio (an American country hit for Porter Wagoner and a British pop hit for Olivia Newton-John), Blaydon races (a song about a day at the races, made famous by its adoption as the anthem of Newcastle United - it's a pity the racecourse no longer exists), Lord of the dance, Amazing grace and We shall not be moved. Also here is a cover of Last thing on my mind (Tom Paxton), showing their ability to record contemporary material. There are also plenty of obscure songs that suit their style.\n\nIf you enjoy easy-listening music, you will probably enjoy the (British) Spinners and it may arouse your curiosity enough to explore folk music further. If you are already a folk music fan, you must decide whether the style of the music here appeals to you. Of course, if you enjoy both folk AND easy-listening music, you'll love this.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28689873736e0e0d184365d88ab4a80a9d47aa3a","amp;dn":"The+Spinners...The+Spinners%281994%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28689873736e0e0d184365d88ab4a80a9d47aa3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,104,152,115,115,110,14,13,24,67,101,216,138,180,168,10,157,71,170,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
