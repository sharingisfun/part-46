On a train journey from Scotland to London in 1934, Tey meets a fan, Elspeth Simmons, who's traveling to the capital to attend a performance of Tey's hit play about Richard II. When Simmons is found brutally murderedÃ¢â‚¬â€stabbed with a hatpin, posed with some dolls and partially shavedÃ¢â‚¬â€after arrival at King's Cross, Tey's Scotland Yard friend, Insp. Archie Penrose, investigates and soon learns that the victim was adopted under irregular circumstances. After another death, the evidence suggests that both crimes are linked to a murder committed amid the devastating trench warfare of WWI. While the heroine falls conventionally into the killer's clutches before a solution many will anticipate, the engaging prose will leave even readers unfamiliar with Tey's fiction eagerly looking forward to the next in the series","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:542dea6d640563221189516d851eb45096a144e4","amp;dn":"An+Expert+in+Murder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"542dea6d640563221189516d851eb45096a144e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,45,234,109,100,5,99,34,17,137,81,109,133,30,180,80,150,161,68,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
