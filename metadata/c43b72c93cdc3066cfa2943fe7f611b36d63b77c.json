It discusses the meaning of Allah\\'s name: An-Nur (the Light). No doubt lots of Muslims did not read about its meaning due to its being obvious but we should take much care of knowing any aspect of Islam even if we think it is very clear. Dr. Saleh As-Saleh explains its meaning through explaining the verse in which it is mentioned in Surat An-Nur.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c43b72c93cdc3066cfa2943fe7f611b36d63b77c","amp;dn":"Explaining+the+Meaning+of+An-Nur+%28the+Light%29%2C+One+of+Allah%5C%27s+Na","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c43b72c93cdc3066cfa2943fe7f611b36d63b77c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,59,114,201,60,220,48,102,207,162,148,63,231,246,17,179,109,99,183,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
