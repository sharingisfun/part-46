The show was issued in an edited form first on VHS and then DVD. Now for the first time the full concert is being released as a double CD in the original running order and with remastered sound. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an extraordinary live show with a giant animatronic dragon towering over the stage and spectacular lasers and pyrotechnics. Ronnie James Dio is in fine voice as ever and the band deliver a blistering live performance featuring tracks from their first three albums alongside Black Sabbath and Rainbow classics. This will be a must-have release for any Dio fan!\n\nTracklist:\n\n01. Draco Ignis\n02. King Of Rock And Roll\n03. Like The Beat Of A Heart\n04. Don't Talk To Strangers\n05. Hungry For Heaven\n06.
