Rebel (as sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s known) decides to complete the dead girlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bucket list to prove that choice, not chance, controls her fate. In doing so, she unexpectedly opens her mind and heart to a world she once dismissedÃ¢â‚¬â€a world of friendships, family, and faith. With a shaken sense of self, she must reevaluate her loner philosophyÃ¢â‚¬â€particularly when she falls for Nate, the golden boy do-gooder who never looks out for himself. \n\nPerfect for fans of Jay AsherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blockbuster hit Thirteen Reasons Why, CoriellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second novel features her sharp, engaging voice along with realistic drama and unforgettable characters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eca650afa188f58c41ad8e15123f8bee41137bc4","amp;dn":"Shelley+Coriell+Goodbye+Rebel+Blue+epub+mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eca650afa188f58c41ad8e15123f8bee41137bc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,166,80,175,161,136,245,140,65,173,142,21,18,63,139,238,65,19,123,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
