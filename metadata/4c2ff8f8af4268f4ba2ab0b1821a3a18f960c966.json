Lohrke VINE VOICE\n0898 features some of the beautiful south's greatest singles: 'old red eyes is back,' 'we are each other,' and '36D.' each song showcases dave rotherway's classic songwriting skills and paul heaton's incredibly clever lyrics. other tracks, like the mournful 'the rocking chair,' the biting 'something that you said, (with the brutal lyric 'when you walk into your house and she's cutting up your mother, she's only trying to tell you that she loves you like no other' and 'the perfect love song, it has no words, it only has death threats) and 'i'm your no. 1 fan' also proudly show off the beautiful south's impeccable gifts for arrangement and melody. and paul heaton, for my money, has one of the best vox's around: it's husky and powerful at times, but suprisingly tender and effective when it needs to be. the man has range like few others (check out 'let love speak up itself' off 'choke') and comes off even sounding better when he's up against the incomparable brianna (who sadly left after this album). the call-and-response of 'we are each other' alone is worth the price of this album.\n\ntop to bottom, 0898 is their most complete album. most beautiful south albums have a miss or two, but 0898 is dud-free. more recent beautiful south albums seem to have lost an ounce or two of the spark that made them so great, but they're still a great band and worthy of your hard earned caish. i remember seeing the beautiful south in SLC back in 1992 supporting this disc. i saw them again in 2000 in hollywood at the house of blues. both shows were incredible. unfortunately, the beautiful south seem doomed to relative obscurity in the states, and that's a shame because everone deserves a trip to the beautiful south.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c2ff8f8af4268f4ba2ab0b1821a3a18f960c966","amp;dn":"The+Beautiful+South-0898+320cbr+%28Big+Papi%29+1992+British+Adult+Al","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c2ff8f8af4268f4ba2ab0b1821a3a18f960c966","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,47,248,248,175,66,104,244,186,42,176,177,130,26,58,24,249,96,201,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
