Yet an in-depth exploration of the ways in which dominant interest groups distort the available science to support their positions has received little attention in the academic or popular literature.\n\nThe book begins by establishing non-controversial principles of good scientific practice. These principles then serve as the benchmark against which each chapter author compares how science is misused in a specific regulatory setting and assist in isolating problems in the integration of science by the regulatory process.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4099d9a9a680528c9e23c124c148988a6e61508","amp;dn":"Rescuing+Science+From+Politics%3A+Regulation+%26+The+Distortion+Of+S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4099d9a9a680528c9e23c124c148988a6e61508","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,9,157,154,154,104,5,40,201,226,60,18,76,20,137,136,166,230,21,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
