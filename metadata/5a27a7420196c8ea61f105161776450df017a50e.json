If you are not familiar with Mr.Harvey,here is a short bio.\nBorn: 4 September 1918\nDied: 28 February 2009\nBirthplace: Tulsa, Oklahoma\nBest known as: The host of Paul Harvey radio news\nName at birth: Paul Harvey Aurandt\n\nThe radio show Paul Harvey News and Comment was first broadcast nationally in 1951 and continued into the 21st century, making Harvey one of the longest-lasting and best-known voices on American radio. Harvey's program -- an idiosyncratic mix of headlines, comments, quips and advertisements, all voiced by Harvey -- was syndicated at its peak to more than 1200 radio stations around the country each day. Harvey was famous for his work ethic: he wrote and recorded his shows six days a week from studios in Chicago. His brisk, quirky delivery and signature greeting &quot;Hello, Americans!&quot; were widely (if fondly) parodied. In 1976 Harvey began a companion radio feature, The Rest of the Story, telling little-known tales from the lives of famous people. He continued working right up until his death at age 90. Harvey was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame in 1990","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a27a7420196c8ea61f105161776450df017a50e","amp;dn":"If+I+Were+The+Devil-Paul+Harvey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a27a7420196c8ea61f105161776450df017a50e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,39,167,66,1,150,200,234,97,241,5,22,23,118,69,13,240,23,165,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
