The new, full-colour Rough Guide to India gives you the lowdown on this beguiling country, whether you want to hang out in hyper-modern cities or explore thousand-year-old temples, track tigers through the forest or take part in age-old festivals, get a taste of the Raj or watch a cricket match. And easy-to-use maps, reliable transport advice, and expert reviews of the best hotels, restaurants, bars, clubs and shops for all budgets ensure that you won't miss a thing.
