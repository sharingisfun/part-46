Comes w/\nMalwareByets Anti-Malware + McAfee AV,updated as of 25-Jan-10, Windows\nExplorer, SmartDriverBackup, PCITREE, CPUZ, FoxIt PDF Reader, Firefox,\nFileZilla FTP Client, Ghost 11, UltraVNC, Partition Magic 8, CHNTPW\n(now Vista-compatible), WIPECMOS, MEMTEST, the Hitachi/Seagate/WD\nhard drive diagnostics, etc.  Boots to WinPE by default.\n\nWhat is WinPE ?  It's a limited version of Windows XP, bootable from\nyour own media, so that you can prepare a naked PC for installation of\nan operating system or rescue a damaged system when it won't boot\nproperly.  WinPE, therefore, looks and behaves like the OS you know\nbest and gives you an opportunity to fix things as opposed to simply\nwiping the hard drive and redoing the PC from scratch.\n\nStarting with HawkPE #41, there are two separate downloads: a CD ISO\n(without Slax and other goodies) and a DVD ISO (the full treatment.)\nThe split has permitted the addition of a few more diagnostics/tools\nto the CD image, while eliminating the Linux payload for those who\nsimply never did/will grok/want Linux.\n\nFor those who've been asking, there's now a procedure to transfer\nHAWKPE to a USB thumb drive and make it bootable, along w/ other\ntidbits in the HAWKPE-CHANGES, README-HAWKPE, and HAWKPE-USB-HOWTO\ntext files !\n\nSlax is an excellent example of a portable Linux, which comes w/\nFirefox-2+Flash-9, KDE's KOffice suite, multimedia goodies, and the\nlatest K3B CD/DVD burning application.  So with a USB thumb drive and\nyour HAWKPE CD/DVD, you can carry a multimedia-enabled computer\nsystem, with you at all times.  Slax also makes for a more informative\ndiagnostic than the stand-alones like Microscope and PC Doctor.\nEnjoy....\n\nAs a recap, here's the most up-to-date inventory of what's on the\ndisc:\n\nA2Hijack\nAusLogic Defrag\nBroadcom 44xx-NIC Drivers\nBroadcom Extreme-NIC Drivers\nChange NT/2K/XP/2K3/Vista Passwords\nCPUZ\nDarik's Boot and Nuke\nDriversPack.net Stand-Alone Driver Installer (DVD Only)\nERD Commander 2005\nFilezilla\nFirefox\nFoxIt PDF Reader\nGhost 11\nHardware Detection Tool\nHDDScan\nHitachi Disk Fitness Test\nHWPnP\nIntel-10-100-1000MHz NIC Drivers\nIntel-810 Display Drivers\nIntel-Extreme Display Drivers\nJoshua's Key Reader\nLLFTOOL\nMalwarebytes Anti-Malware\nMicroscope 2005\nMcAfee AV Scanner\nMemtest86\nMemtestPlus\nMHDD Hard Drive Repair/Analysis Utility\nNSSI\nNT PswdEdit\nnVidia Display Drivers\nPartition Magic 8\nPCITree\nPowerDefragmenter\nPuTTY\nPython\nSala Password Renew-Beta\nSamsung HUTIL Hard Drive Diagnostics\nSeaTools (Seagate/Maxtor) Drive Diagnostics\nSlax 6 (DVD Only)\nSmart Driver Backup\nSpinRite\nTFTPD32\nTreesize Pro\nUltraVNC\nUnknown Devive Identifier\nViewCHM\nWCPUID\nWestern Digital Drive Diagnostics 5\nWindows File Explorer\nWinRAR\n\nPS: Download all components in order to extract the payload.

Regretably, Lavasoft stopped updating\nAdAware Pro 6 (really good program) and since I never really thought\nClamWin did that good of a job *and* was slow to scan, let's just rip\nthem both out and make room for something/anything else.  (For the\nrecord, I **still** include the McAfee scanner bec it **works**, not\nas effectively as other AV scanners, but then the alternatives don't\noperate under WinPE/HawkPE **at all**.)  I don't use HawkPE/WinPE\n*often* (note the word *often*) for actual virus/malware cleaning and\nfavor a much more reliable cleaning method: delete a corrupt Windows\nand replace it w/ a fresh copy of the operating system.  However, when\ncustomers insist on retaining the OS *and* their installed\napps/drivers, there's MalwareBytes Anti-Malware [MBAM] !\n\nThis iteration of MBAM isn't as stable as I'd like, but I've used it\nsuccessfully for many months (since I discovered the UBCD4WIN project\nhad a working BartPE plugin), so here it is.  The biggest caveats are:\n\n**  the loader that launches MBAM will only do so *ONCE* per run of\nHawkPE/WinPE; so if MBAM crashes or simply doesn't load, one must\nreboot HawkPE/WinPE  &lt;sigh&gt;\n\n**  after scanning for malware w/ MBAM, the dialog that saves the log\nfile &quot;works&quot;, but the combox for choosing the destination folder for\nthe file doesn't work right away *and* you have to keep pressing the\nSave button repeatedly to make it do so  &lt;sigh&gt;\n\n**  since MBAM doesn't know jack about WinPE, it will try to restart\nitself on the next launch of Windows itself (to delete certain files);\nnothing to be concerned about here, just a simple heads-up\n\n**  one must explicitly select only what you want to scan for (the\nbottom three check boxes: files, registry entries, and\nextra/heuristics objects) on the Settings tab\n\nAccording to the MBAM forum, the program's authors have decided to do\nan official BartPE plugin, but there's no date for that and the\naforementioned announcement was issued in April '09, so don't hold\nyour breath waiting for the plugin.  Fact is, malware cleaning is/will\nalways be a hit-miss proposition.  The most agressive intruders are\nvery ingenious in finding multiple reinfection vectors (startup\npoints) and strategies, so after spending *hours* performing a deep\nscan w/ a couple different tools, you may still be SOL (simply out of\nluck.)  Moreover, some intruders damage the TCP/IP stack or Internet\nExplorer, so even if do purge them, the PC *may* no longer connect to\nthe outside world, requiring a reinstall anyway.  When you use MBAM,\ngive it time to load, bec it does take some time (up to a minute) on\nslower PCs.\n\nAnyway, I will continue to keep my eye open for anything else which\nmight help defeat the malware threat.  Spybot comes to mind, but I\nneed to free up a lot more space before it will &quot;join the family.&quot;\nPrior to adding MBAM, HawkPE/WinPE already *had* a2-hijack and\nSysInternals Autoruns, so I want to remind that I haven't completely\nabandoned the idea of malware detection/cleaning.\n\nBriefly, about the other additions:\n\n**  Firefox and FileZilla are based on the latest versions from the\nPortableApps suite.  They got a special treatment for HawkPE, where\nthey are wrapped in a SFX which will automagically launch them from\nCOMMON on the RAM drive (R:).  However (*AND* this is *IMPORTANT*),\nthey can't be used SIMULATANEOULY, since they share the same folder\nand each launcher will delete the current contents of R:COMMON,\nbefore extracting its own payload.  This is intended to cut down on\noverall failures in HawkPE, due to exhausting all TEMP space on the\nRAM drive\n\n**  Joshua's Key Reader is central to why *I* started using BartPE to\ncreate HawkPE/WinPE, ie. to be able to retrieve information from a\ndead or hopelessly damaged Windows, like a product key \n\n**  NT Pswd Edit, just like Joshua's Key Reader, is one of those tools\npermits to *fix* a broken Windows installation (I routinely encounter\ncustomers at my day job, who need help removing an account password),\ninstead of **reformatting**\n\n**  There are times when I need to get a quick overview of the\nhardware in a PC and for this purpose I've added HDT (Hardware\nDetection Tool) from the SYSLINUX suite\n\n**  The DriverPacks.net stand-alone driver installer for Windows\nXP/2003 (only).  In case you need a ready-made source of drivers, to\ncomplete an installation of Windows XP/2003, look no further.\nHowever, it must be understood that this installer is **ONLY** to be\nused from within a real, operational instance of Windows, **not**\nHawkPE/WinPE; just navigate to the DPSADriverPacks.net folder on the\nDVD, then run the DP_Install_Tool.cmd batch script.  The script will\nattempt to install device support from a tested library of hundreds of\nmfr's device drivers in the audio, chipset, CPU, graphics, LAN, mass\nstorage, and WLAN categories, for any unknown devices.  Have even\nkicked in the UAA service pack (KB888111) for both XP/2003, in case\nyou have one of those new-fangled HD audio adapters, which will\n**only** install *after* the UAA upgrade.  Do I have to say it, but\nthe DriverPacks stand-alone installer is **ONLY* on the DVD edition of\nHawkPE !\n\nIt's regretable that it's been an entire year since the last release\nand as always, I hope the next iteration won't take as long to\nrelease.  I'm hopeful that we can keep a two-month schedule between\nreleases this year.  Enjoy....\n\n:--  The Hawk  --:\n\n\n==========================================================  25-Jan-10  ==\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1eafefa4b1422ccd11addc2496ad68dfed59dd0d","amp;dn":"HawkPE-43-CD+The+PC+Tech%5C%27s+Swiss+Army+Knife","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1eafefa4b1422ccd11addc2496ad68dfed59dd0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,175,239,164,177,66,44,205,17,173,220,36,150,173,104,223,237,89,221,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
