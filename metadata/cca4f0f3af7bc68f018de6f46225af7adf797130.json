After a rogue robot killed her scientist mother, Tess fled with a terrible secret to the desperate, arid Badlands, where sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recruited by Kudzu, explained to her as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“nonviolent collective working to undermine the Trust and free the Badlands.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Learning Kudzu plans to destroy Aevum, the TrustÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latest advanced robot, Tess reluctantly returns to Eden, where she finds the luxurious life morally unconscionable and secretly trains with Kudzu. Living with her uncle, whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s involved with Aevum, Tess is strangely attracted to his sympathetic assistant, Hunter. During a Kudzu raid on the TrustÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lab, Tess discovers that Aevum will be used to eradicate all inhabitants of the BadlandsÃ¢â‚¬â€and that HunterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not what he seems to be. \n\nTessÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ first-person, present-tense voice lends chilling immediacy to her no-nonsense story of mixed loyalty, disturbing secrets, and ethical dilemmas associated with diminishing natural resources and scientific experimentation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cca4f0f3af7bc68f018de6f46225af7adf797130","amp;dn":"Parched+by+Georgia+Clark+%28PDF%2C+EPUB%2C+MOBI%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cca4f0f3af7bc68f018de6f46225af7adf797130","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,164,240,243,175,123,198,143,1,141,230,244,98,37,175,122,223,121,113,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
