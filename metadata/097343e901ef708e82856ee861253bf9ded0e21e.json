An epic portrait of Japan in crisis, it combines graphic military history and highly readable fiction to depict an aspiring nation modernizing at breakneck speed. Best-selling author Shiba RyÃ…ï¿½tarÃ…ï¿½ devoted an entire decade of his life to this extraordinary blockbuster, which features Japan's emerging onto the world stage by the early years of the 20th century.\n\nVolume I describes the growth of JapanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fledgling Meiji state, a major &quot;character&quot; in the novel. We are also introduced to our three heroes, born into obscurity, the brothers Akiyama Yoshifuru and Akiyama Saneyuki, who will go on to play important roles in the Japanese Army and Navy, and the poet Masaoka Shiki, who will spend much of his short life trying to establish the haiku as a respected poetic form.\n\nIn Volume II, Meiji Japan is on a collision course with Russia, as Russian troops stationed in Manchuria ignore repeated calls to withdraw. Admiral TÃ…ï¿½gÃ…ï¿½ leads a blockade and subsequent skirmish at the strategically vital and heavily fortified Port Arthur, whilst YoshifuruÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cavalry in Manchuria maneuvers for position as it approaches the Russian Army lines. The two armies clash at the battle of Liaoyang, where Japan seals a victory which shocks the world.\n\nVolume three finds Admiral TÃ…ï¿½gÃ…ï¿½ continuing his blockade of Port Arthur. Meanwhile, a Japanese land offensive gains control of the high ground overlooking the bay as the Russians at last call for a ceasefire. However, on the banks of the Shaho River, the Japanese lines are stretched, but the Russian General Kuropatkin makes a decision to flank the troops to the left and in doing so encounters Akiyama YoshifuruÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cavalry.\n\nVolume IV begins with the dramatic battle of Mukden where Akiyama YoshifuruÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cavalry play a major part in the action against the Cossacks. Meanwhile, Admiral TÃ…ï¿½gÃ…ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s fleet sail to the Tsushima strait to intercept the Baltic Fleet en route to Vladivostok. With the help of Akiyama SaneyukiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strategies, the Baltic Fleet is totally destroyed and the Japanese fleet make a triumphant return to Yokohama.\n\n Anyone curious as to how the &quot;tiny, rising nation of Japan&quot; was able to fight so fiercely for its survival should look no further. Clouds above the Hill is an exciting, human portrait of a modernizing nation that goes to war and thereby stakes its very existence on a desperate bid for glory in East Asia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:097343e901ef708e82856ee861253bf9ded0e21e","amp;dn":"Clouds+above+the+Hill%3A+Novel+of+the+Russo-Japanese+War+%284+v%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"097343e901ef708e82856ee861253bf9ded0e21e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,115,67,233,1,239,112,142,130,133,110,232,97,37,59,249,222,208,226,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
