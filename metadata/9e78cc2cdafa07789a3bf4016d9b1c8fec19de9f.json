Today, science forecasts that the oceans are getting fiercer, rising up to reshape our coastlines and create untold devastation, social unrest and economic crisis. \n\n\nUNDERWATER UNIVERSE tracks the history and evolution of the ocean's seven deadliest zones ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ locations that throughout history have been the direct causes of human devastation by floods, tsunamis, hurricanes, whirlpools, ice, underwater volcanoes, and shipping graveyards. Using expedition footage, 3D animation, and commentary from leading oceanographers, UNDERWATER UNIVERSE helps depict the awesome cosmic and geological fluctuations that make the oceans deadly over time. \n\n\nSee how, with advances in navigation, engineering, and meteorology, people today have learned to avoid some of these catastrophes. But our sophisticated technologies have also created new threats, and the possibility that our own actions are making the oceans deadlier is becoming greater. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Jonathan Adams\n===========================\n\n\nDirected by: Lisa Wolfinger\n===========================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    Underwater Universe\nYear.................:    2009\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    01:30:20\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3)\nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    624x352\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    1689 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (N/A) \nFile Size:...........:    1.06 GB\nFPS..................:    25.000000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2009 \n\n\n\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1470714/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1470714/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\\\\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\\\\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\\\\\&quot;nfo\\\\\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            *** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e78cc2cdafa07789a3bf4016d9b1c8fec19de9f","amp;dn":"Underwater+Universe-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e78cc2cdafa07789a3bf4016d9b1c8fec19de9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,120,204,44,218,250,7,120,154,59,244,1,109,155,28,143,236,25,222,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
