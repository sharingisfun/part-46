Head First C provides a complete learning experience for C and structured imperative programming. With a unique method that goes beyond syntax and how-to manuals, this guide not only teaches you the language, it helps you understand how to be a great programmer. You'll learn key areas such as language basics, pointers and pointer arithmetic, and dynamic memory management. Advanced topics include multi-threading and network programmingÃ¢â‚¬â€topics typically covered on a college-level course.\n\nThis book also features labs: in-depth projects intended to stretch your abilities, test your new skills, and build confidence. Head First C mimics the style of college-level C courses, making it ideal as an accessible textbook for students.We think your time is too valuable to waste struggling with new concepts. Using the latest research in cognitive science and learning theory to craft a multi-sensory learning experience, Head First C uses a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works, not a text-heavy approach that puts you to sleep.\n\n\n------------------\ntweet us @teamGOLU\nKeep Learning and help us to share the knowledge across the world.\n-------------\n\nMore eBooks &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/GOLU&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/GOLU&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFind me on SuprBay &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/User-GOLU&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/User-GOLU&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48aee2150401c9e3a510fb2ab78a6f494f647ba0","amp;dn":"Head+First+C+-+O%27Reilly+%282012%29+PDF+-+GOLU","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48aee2150401c9e3a510fb2ab78a6f494f647ba0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,174,226,21,4,1,201,227,165,16,251,42,183,138,111,73,79,100,123,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
