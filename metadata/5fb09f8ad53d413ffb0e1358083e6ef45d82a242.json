Consequently, the 'best of' release &quot;The First Million Miles&quot; has now been supplemented by this new release, &quot;The First Million Miles, Volume 2&quot; which picks up many of the tracks left off of the first volume. You may expect these to be the less essential Staines songs; however, this cd is actually better than the first compliation. If you are only going to own one Bill Staines cd or want a sampler of his music, this cd is the place to start. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweamp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/02/07/bill-staines/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/02/07/bill-staines/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fb09f8ad53d413ffb0e1358083e6ef45d82a242","amp;dn":"Bill+Staines...The+First+Million+Miles%2C+Vol.+2%281998%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fb09f8ad53d413ffb0e1358083e6ef45d82a242","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,176,159,138,213,61,65,63,251,14,19,88,8,62,110,244,93,130,162,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
