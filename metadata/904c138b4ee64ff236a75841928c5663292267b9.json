In Shootout of the Mountain Man, Billy Ray Cabot is set to hang, but the people planning to string him up havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t reckoned on his old association with Smoke Jensen. As loyal as the trees are tall, Smoke will move Heaven and Earth to save a friendÃ¢â‚¬â€even if it means riding into a bloody war thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sure to mean the death of more than one man.
