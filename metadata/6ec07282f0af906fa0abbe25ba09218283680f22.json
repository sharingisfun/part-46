Express. He played synthesizer bass using the miniMoog while touring with the group. After leaving the band in the early 1980s, Kashif recorded demos with the band Stepping Stone, which led to his eventual solo signing with Arista Records.\n\nIntroduced to Arista by Gerry Griffith, its A&amp;R director in 1983, his self-titled debut Kashif (1983) spawned the hits &quot;I Just Gotta Have You (Lover Turn Me On),&quot; &quot;Stone Love,&quot; &quot;Help Yourself to My Love,&quot; and &quot;Say Something Love.&quot; With this release, Kashif was well received as an innovator in music, as R&amp;B artists were only beginning to experiment with synthesizers and other electronic instruments. He is said to have been Arista Records' attempt to respond to Warner Bros. Records' Prince.\n\nKashifs most famous artist is Evelyn Champagne King whom he wrote many of her BIG HITS.\n\nThis is a great discography to own, so here it is..\n\nIncluded with this torrent are the albums:\n\n1983 - Kashif\n1984 - Live In Concert\n1984 - Send Me Your Love\n1985 - Condition Of The Heart\n1987 - Love Changes\n1989 - kashif\n1994 - The Best Of Kashif\n1998 - The Definitive Collection\n1998 - Who Loves You\n2002 - Best Of Kashif\n2004 - Music From My Mind","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ec07282f0af906fa0abbe25ba09218283680f22","amp;dn":"KASHIF+DISCOGRAPHY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ec07282f0af906fa0abbe25ba09218283680f22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,192,114,130,240,175,144,111,160,171,190,37,186,9,33,130,131,104,15,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
