Here, the story continues through the fourth century B.C. to the days of Alexander the Great. The innovations of the period are discussed, such as the female nude and portraiture, along with many important monuments including the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus and several of the great names such as Praxiteles and Lysippus who were lionized by later generations. The volume also presents Greek sculpture made in the colonies of Italy and Sicily from the Archaic period onwards, as well as that made for eastern, non-Greek rulers. A final section considers the role of Greek sculpture in moulding western taste to the present day","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:670a0d5f3e9f196820fc0fe6093f27b6756534eb","amp;dn":"Greek+Sculpture+-+The+Archaic+Period+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"670a0d5f3e9f196820fc0fe6093f27b6756534eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,10,13,95,62,159,25,104,32,252,15,230,9,63,39,182,117,101,52,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
