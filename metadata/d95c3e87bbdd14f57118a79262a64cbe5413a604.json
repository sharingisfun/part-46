In this version I included proper tags, lyrics, and album art\n\n\n\nNotes from the official website (http://www.dalermehndi.com):\n\n\n Five years of musical voyage since the last release, &amp; Daler Mehndi precedes with TUMBA that pans across various genres exploring exciting musical direction. Highly exhilarating composition set to the notes of diverse Raagas including Raag Kirwani, Raag Bhimpalasi, Raag Charukesi, Raag Tilak Kamod, Raag Sarang, Raag Bhoopkali, Raag Pahari, &amp; Raag Saraswati, Tumba is an absolute confluence.\n\nThe album is not a contrived attempt by Mehndi to deliver accessible music. It is his penchant for eclecticism stimulating him to deliver music which outclasses all he has done in past.  Not just better, but lot bigger!\n \n\nTrivia\n\nThe title track Ã¢â‚¬ËœTumbaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was set within a rhythmic framework of over 80 percussions! The music arrangement for Tumba was initially done using computer programming. Mehndi felt that the music sounded feeble (Ã¢â‚¬Å“chhota sound kar raha haiÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, he said) in the produced result, and wanted to dub acoustics into it. So Raju Sardar was called. He came in big van, almost a mini truck full of instruments, nothing less than 85 in number, and all of them were used in the track! One antra has the dhol as the main rhythm, other used Djembe and Darabuka. Rain effects, Warrior sounds, and other percussions including. tabla, , tom 20 pieces, ball shakers, shehs, matka, madal, duff, manjeera, timpani, tibalee, bass duff, tiko, miko have been used.\n\nThe super hit Ã¢â‚¬ËœSheila ho ya MunniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was actually extempored by Mehndi at an international show &amp; was well received at the first take! So much so that Mehndi decided to deliver the song in the album.\n\nFor the first time, Daler Mehndi also incorporated Haryanvi language in his music. It is interesting to see a Punjabi pop singer move from Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and now to Haryanvi.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d95c3e87bbdd14f57118a79262a64cbe5413a604","amp;dn":"Daler+Mehndi+-+Tunak+Tunak+Tumba+%282011%29+%5BMP3+-+320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d95c3e87bbdd14f57118a79262a64cbe5413a604","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,92,62,135,187,221,20,245,113,24,167,146,98,166,76,190,84,19,166,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
