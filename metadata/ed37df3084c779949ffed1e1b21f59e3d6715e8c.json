BE AWARE ANYTHING BY THIS CANADIAN IS ALL LIES.\n\nFax is the leader of BiOSHOCK and HaZMaT, HaZMaT loves to include fake info about sites in their nfos and aswell bashing other groups and curries, please be aware this group is banned on most top sites.\n\nOkay with that being cleared off the way.\n\n\nThis scene notice is about the Satcon AKA satcom danish racer from the group PATH\n\nThis guy is supporting fax and BiRD in his quest to nfo sites and threaten the sites.\n\nWe're aware Satcon has been flaming most scene groups forever, And I wonder to myself why do sites still let him race their sites? the scene isnt about flaming other groups or sites or even curries\n\nSo anyways I decided since I knew fax's link it was time to try a trick, I waited for hours till his bnc died and took over for a few mins\n\nin that time I pm'd Satcon and guess what......the epicness happened I mean I jizzed in my pants.\n\n\n(12:25:) (g4): nigger :&gt;\n(12:26:) (Satcon): hi fax\n(12:28:) (Satcon): so who's our next target gonna be?
