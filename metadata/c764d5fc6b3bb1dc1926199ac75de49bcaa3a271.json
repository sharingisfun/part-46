John Garfield, Eleanor Parker, Dane Clark\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038000/\r\n\r\n\r\nAcademy Awards - NOMINATED - Best Writing\r\n\r\nBased on the real-life story of Marine Sgt. Al Schmid, who won the Navy Cross for defending a machine-gun post one night on Guadalcanal and was blinded along toward morning by a grenade burst after he had killed 200 Japanese. This film is a splendid documentation of a dramatic crisis in a hero's life. Writer Albert Maltz took the journalistic accounts of Schmid's experience and translated them into a solid, credible drama, composed of taut situation and dialogue. A remarkably natural production by Warner Brothers gives the story integrity. To say that this picture is entertaining to a truly surprising degree is an inadequate recommendation. Of particular note, the segment depicting Al Schmid's combat on Guadalcanal is superbly done and is so technically accurate that it might serve as an instructional film on use of the Browning M1917 heavy machine gun.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 640x480, 23.976 fps, 1544 Kbps, 01h59m40s\r\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, joint stereo, 128 kbps\r\nRatio: 4:3\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio\r\n\r\nOptional subtitles Argentino, English, Portuguese-Brazil, Spanish\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttps://postimg.org/image/b17fesy4h/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttps://postimg.org/image/ymtnlhw9t/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/myzlqy74x/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/qjvha6boh/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/qla0hc2w1/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c764d5fc6b3bb1dc1926199ac75de49bcaa3a271","amp;dn":"Pride+of+the+Marines+%5B1945+-+USA%5D+%28John+Garfield%29+WWII","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c764d5fc6b3bb1dc1926199ac75de49bcaa3a271","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,100,213,252,107,59,177,220,25,38,25,154,199,93,228,155,202,163,162,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
