Some hold it to be purely physical, while others believe it transcends the material world. Now comes a book that offers a new perspective - based entirely on evidence from the natural sciences - whereby materialism and dualism co-exist. The author - a distinguished pioneer of nonlinear dynamics - bases his argument on a hierarchical view of mental organization; a stairway. Atoms give rise to molecules, neurons form the brain and individual consciousness leads to shared culture. All steps are needed to complete the picture and each level derives from the previous one. The book shows specialists how each of their fields adds to the overall picture, while providing general readers with an introduction to this investigation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4588a58c006990e002122305aa0171544c5ab3ad","amp;dn":"Stairway+to+the+Mind%3A+The+Controversial+New+Science","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4588a58c006990e002122305aa0171544c5ab3ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,136,165,140,0,105,144,224,2,18,35,5,170,1,113,84,76,90,179,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
