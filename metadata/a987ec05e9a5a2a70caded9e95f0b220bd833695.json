Recorded last year in Bill Laswell's New Jersey studio (but without his\nheavy-handed production aesthetic), this unadorned acoustic session documents\ntwo of the world's most versatile and virtuosic improvisers working through a\nset of six new compositions written by Smith.\n\nLegendary veterans whose seminal innovations can be traced to the late '60s,\nSmith was a charter member of the AACM, while DeJohnette served with Miles Davis\nduring his influential fusion period. Their finely tuned rapport was rekindled\nin the company of pianist Anthony Davis and late bassist Malachi Favors in the\nfirst version of Smith's Golden Quartet. Favors passing in 2004 disbanded the\noriginal line-up, leaving their first two albums, Golden Quartet (Tzadik, 2000)\nand Year of the Elephant (Pi, 2002) as definitive examples of creative\nimprovised music for the new century.\n\nOpening with celebratory fanfare, the episodic &quot;America Parts 1, 2, 3&quot; gradually\nsegues from brassy, martial turbulence into spacious impressionism that quotes\nthe Dark Prince's &quot;Concierto De Aranjuez&quot; before returning to a climactic vortex\nof clarion trumpet calls and frenetic trap set ruminations. &quot;John Brown's Fort&quot;\nand &quot;Masnavi: The Falcon and the Owls&quot; spotlight Smith's smeary chromatic\nflurries and DeJohnette's ricocheting rhythms while &quot;Red Trumpet&quot; and the\nlyrical &quot;Ed Blackwell, the Blue Mountain Sun Drummer&quot; demonstrate their adroit\nuse of spatial dynamics, as Smith's recoiling lines weave around DeJohnette's\nelastic downbeats with nimble dexterity. &quot;Rabi'a's Unconditional Love, a\nSpiritual Mystery of the Heart&quot; offers introspective respite, in which Smith's\ndelicate muted refrains are accompanied by DeJohnette's tastefully spare\naccents.\n\nDespite their limited palette, Smith and DeJohnette reveal a wealth of\nexpressionistic possibilities. Bringing years of experience into play, each\napproaches the jazz tradition from opposite ends of the musical spectrum, yet\nthey make a perfectly balanced pair. Smith's protean timbre and abstruse\ncadences are delivered with studied virtuosity, while DeJohnette executes\nintricate polyrhythmic fragments and elaborate fills with freewheeling\nverve. Exuding a primordial timelessness reminiscent of an extended ritual\ninvocation, their empathetic dialog surpasses contemporary trends and stylistic\nprecedents. Their interplay is measured and precise, neither overwrought nor\ntimid, lending America an air of regal austerityÃƒÂ¢","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a987ec05e9a5a2a70caded9e95f0b220bd833695","amp;dn":"Wadada+Leo+Smith+and+Jack+DeJohnette+-+America+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a987ec05e9a5a2a70caded9e95f0b220bd833695","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,135,236,5,233,165,162,167,12,173,237,158,149,240,178,32,189,131,54,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
