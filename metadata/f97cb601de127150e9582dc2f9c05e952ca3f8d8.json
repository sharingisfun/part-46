Their meteoric rise began in 2005, when the teenagers fielded offers from major labels and drew a sold-out crowd to the London Astoria, using little more than a self-released EP as bait. Several months later, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not became the fastest-selling debut album in British history, entrenching Arctic Monkeys in the same circle as multi-platinum acts like Oasis and Blur.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f97cb601de127150e9582dc2f9c05e952ca3f8d8","amp;dn":"Arctic+Monkeys+-+AM+%282013%29+%5BMP3+V0%5D+politux","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f97cb601de127150e9582dc2f9c05e952ca3f8d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,124,182,1,222,18,113,80,233,88,45,194,249,192,94,149,44,163,248,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
