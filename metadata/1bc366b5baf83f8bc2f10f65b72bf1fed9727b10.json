From the slums of the global South to the wealthy financial centers of the West, Cities Under Siege traces the spread of political violence through the sites, spaces, infrastructure and symbols of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rapidly expanding metropolitan areas.\n\nDrawing on a wealth of original research, Stephen Graham shows how Western militaries and security forces now perceive all urban terrain as a conflict zone inhabited by lurking shadow enemies. Urban inhabitants have become targets that need to be continually tracked, scanned and controlled. Graham examines the transformation of Western armies into high-tech urban counter-insurgency forces. He looks at the militarization and surveillance of international borders, the use of Ã¢â‚¬ËœsecurityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ concerns to suppress democratic dissent, and the enacting of legislation to suspend civilian law. In doing so, he reveals how the New Military Urbanism permeates the entire fabric of urban life, from subway and transport networks hardwired with high-tech Ã¢â‚¬Ëœcommand and controlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ systems to the insidious militarization of a popular culture corrupted by the all-pervasive discourse of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœterrorism.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bc366b5baf83f8bc2f10f65b72bf1fed9727b10","amp;dn":"Cities+Under+Siege+The+New+Military+Urbanism","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bc366b5baf83f8bc2f10f65b72bf1fed9727b10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,195,102,181,186,248,63,139,194,241,15,101,183,43,241,254,217,114,123,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
