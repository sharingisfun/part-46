Should we look on this time as still clearly medieval or as one in which humanity took its first decisive steps into modernity? Was it a period as distant from us as it appears, or was it closer than we suspect? Students of history are still trying, even after so many centuries, to reach anything approaching a consensus on the answers to these questions.\n\nPonder the many contradictions on your own and you may be frustrated by inconclusive answers. Instead, let Professor Philip Daileader be your guide and set you on the path to answers with The Late Middle Ages, the final course in his excellent trilogy that began with The Early Middle Ages and The High Middle Ages.\n\nThis provocative 24-lecture course introduces you to the age's major events, personalities, and developments and arms you with the essentials you need to form your own ideas about this age of extremesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½an age that, according to Professor Daileader, &quot;experiences disasters and tragedies of such magnitude that those who survive them cannot remember the like, and doubt that subsequent generations will be capable of believing their descriptions.&quot;\n\n24 Lectures\n30 minutes / lecture\n\n1  Late Middle AgesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Rebirth, Waning, Calamity? \n2  Philip the Fair versus Boniface VIII \n3  Fall of the Templars and the Avignon Papacy \n4  The Great Papal Schism \n5  The Hundred Years War, Part 1 \n6  The Hundred Years War, Part 2 \n7  The Black Death, Part 1 \n8  The Black Death, Part 2 \n9  Revolt in Town and Country \n10 William Ockham \n11 John Wycliffe and the Lollards \n12 Jan Hus and the Hussite Rebellion \n13 Witchcraft \n14 Christine de Pizan and Catherine of Siena \n15 Gunpowder \n16 The Printing Press \n17 Renaissance Humanism, Part 1 \n18 Renaissance Humanism, Part 2 \n19 The Fall of the Byzantine Empire \n20 Ferdinand and Isabella \n21 The Spanish Inquisition \n22 The Age of Exploration \n23 Columbus and the Columbian Exchange \n24 When Did the Middle Ages End?
