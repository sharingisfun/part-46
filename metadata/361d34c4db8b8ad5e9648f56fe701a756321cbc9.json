Told through the eyes of her assassin, the Italian terrorist Luigi Lucheni, it follows Elisabeth from her impetuous, tom-boyish youth, through her falling in love and marrying the young Emperor Franz-Joseph, to her struggles with her strict mother-in-law, disillusionment in her husband, children, and eventual old age. Of course, this musical has a twist, for Death is also a constant watcher in Elisabeth's life, in love with her since she was a child and determined to make her love him in return....&quot;\n\n\nNot my rip!\n\nDVD SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDVD5 \nRe-encoded\n2h 35min\n16:9 (Widescreen)\nLPCM Stereo\nMenus\nBonus Material (Making Of/Backstage)\n\n\n&quot;The Takarazuka Revue (Takarazuka Kagekidan) is a Japanese all-female musical theater in the city of Takarazuka, Hyougo Prefecture, Japan.
