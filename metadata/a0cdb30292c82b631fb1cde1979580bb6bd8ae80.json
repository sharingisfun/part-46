In Physics of the Impossible, the renowned physicist Michio Kaku explores to what extent the technologies and devices of science fiction that are deemed equally impossible today might well become commonplace in the future. \n\nFrom teleportation to telekinesis, Kaku uses the world of science fiction to explore the fundamentalsÃ¢â‚¬â€and the limitsÃ¢â‚¬â€of the laws of physics as we know them today. He ranks the impossible technologies by categoriesÃ¢â‚¬â€Class I, II, and III, depending on when they might be achieved, within the next century, millennia, or perhaps never. In a compelling and thought-provoking narrative, he explains:\nÃ‚Â· How the science of optics and electromagnetism may one day enable us to bend light around an object, like a stream flowing around a boulder, making the object invisible to observers Ã¢â‚¬Å“downstreamÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ‚Â· How ramjet rockets, laser sails, antimatter engines, and nanorockets may one day take us to the nearby stars\nÃ‚Â· How telepathy and psychokinesis, once considered pseudoscience, may one day be possible using advances in MRI, computers, superconductivity, and nanotechnology\nÃ‚Â· Why a time machine is apparently consistent with the known laws of quantum physics, although it would take an unbelievably advanced civilization to actually build one\nKaku uses his discussion of each technology as a jumping-off point to explain the science behind it. An extraordinary scientific adventure, Physics of the Impossible takes readers on an unforgettable, mesmerizing journey into the world of science that both enlightens and entertains.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0cdb30292c82b631fb1cde1979580bb6bd8ae80","amp;dn":"%5B2008%5D+Physics+of+the+Impossible.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0cdb30292c82b631fb1cde1979580bb6bd8ae80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,205,179,2,146,200,43,99,31,177,205,225,151,149,128,187,107,216,174,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
