While it does not contain the significant BBC sessions, B-sides, and album cuts featured on Quite Good!, it does feature superior sound and all the material (such as &quot;Happy Hour,&quot; &quot;Sheep,&quot; &quot;The People Who Grinned Themselves to Death,&quot; and their cover of the Isley Brothers' &quot;Caravan of Love&quot;) that casual fans truly need. Most of the band's biggest fans will tell you, of course, that the two studio albums are absolutely necessary.\nAll Music Review by Andy Kellman\n\n \n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Happy Hour\n[02] Five Get Over Excited\n[03] Caravan Of Love\n[04] Think For A Minute\n[05] Me And The Farmer\n[06] Flag Day [Single Version]\n[07] Sheep\n[08] Build\n[09] There Is Always Something There To Remind Me [John Peel Sessions]\n[10] Anxious\n[11] Hopelessly Devoted To Them\n[12] I Smell Winter\n[13] The People Who Grinned Themselves To Death\n[14] I'll Be Your Shelter (Just Like A Shelter)\n\nPlay Time - 00h:45m:37s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 305mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
