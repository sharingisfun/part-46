Ballon's spanish driver is found shot dead, Inspector Jacques Clouseau is the first official on the scene. All evidence suggests Maria Gambrelli, the maid, to be the murderer. But Clouseau, being attracted to the beautiful girl, is convinced that she is hiding something. So, he has her released from jail and tries to follow her secretly. Things do not work out the way the inspector wanted and people keep being murdered, and each time innocent Maria seems to be the killer. But with someone important wanting Clouseau and nobody else to cover this case, his tolerance-challenged boss Charles Dreyfuss is close to losing his mind when casualties keep turning up. And Clouseau keeps on causing trouble without knowing it...\n\nSCREENSHOTS:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/oapkdaade.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/oapkdaade.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/oapkhaade.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/oapkhaade.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/oapkiaade.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/oapkiaade.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/oapkjaade.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/oapkjaade.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebd98bdb18b353c40609394de0ecb4e3c0a56d95","amp;dn":"A.Shot.In.The.Dark.1964.x264.aac.14.Subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebd98bdb18b353c40609394de0ecb4e3c0a56d95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,217,139,219,24,179,83,196,6,9,57,77,224,236,180,227,192,165,109,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
