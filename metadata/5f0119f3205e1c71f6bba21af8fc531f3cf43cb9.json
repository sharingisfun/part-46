From 700 people gathering in the Black\nMountains in 1994 to 30,000 people gathering among the fields of Eastnor\nCastle Deer Park in 2008, The Big Chill Festival has always been about\ngetting motivated by good music, animated about the arts and passionate\nabout putting on a party.\n\nSo how to celebrate such a milestone? Well you get together all the\ntastemaking DJs, influential artists and the visual visionaries who make\nthe Big Chill experience what it is, and you get them to pick one tune\nthat sums up what the Big Chill festival means to them. Then you put all\nthose tunes of one album and sell it for charity. SoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re doing that.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“15 By 15' is a compilation album with, as the name suggests, 15 luminaries\nof the world that is Big Chill, choosing 15 different tracks to celebrate\nthe festivalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 15th year of existence. The selectors include Mr Norman\nJay MBE, Gilles Peterson, Tom Middleton, Mr Scruff, Coldcut, Tuung, Jon \nHopkins and the Big Chill Forum dwellers to name a few. With such choice\ncuts including tracks from Orbital, The Cinematic Orchestra, 4 Hero,\nThe Orb, Ulrich Schnauss and Jon Shuttleworth, not to mention an exclusive\ncomposition from Tom Middleton himself featuring on the iTunes edition of\nthe album. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“15 By 15' is going to be a souvenir to some, on constant repeat\nfor others and one brilliant compilation for all!\n\nThe album will be released in early March with full details of all the\nselectors and the tracks selected being published on www.bigchill.net soon.\n\nAll the profits from the sale of the album will go to The Big Issue, a\nclose working relationship that continues to bloom between the two 'bigs'\nwith successful initiative after initiative helping the vendors and the\nfestival alike.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f0119f3205e1c71f6bba21af8fc531f3cf43cb9","amp;dn":"VA-15x15_A_Celebration_Of_15_Years_Of_The_Big_Chill-2CD-2009-OBC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f0119f3205e1c71f6bba21af8fc531f3cf43cb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,1,25,243,32,94,28,113,246,187,162,26,248,252,83,31,60,244,60,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
