I haven't included anything they did solo, cause together both I want they should sing...\n\nNot every track is particularly listenable, but quite a few are surprisingly(?) good, and also I'm a completist, so... ENJOY, if you like...\n\nI hope to do another volume in the future of songs from their movies.\n\nCD1:\n1. It's The Talk Of The Town [Live on the Colgate Comedy Hour - 1950.09.17] (2:36)\n2.
