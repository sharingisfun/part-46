Sandra Milo specialised in playing fiery temptresses (In Federico Fellini's 8 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ and Juliet of the Spirits) but here she shows real depth as a woman unsure of where to go in life once her sexuality starts to fade.\n\nWhile its structure is episodic and sprawling, The Visitor adheres to the classic unities of time, place and theme. The film (again co-scripted by Scola) describes the first meeting of two vastly different people who met through an ad in the personal columns. Pina, an employee in an agricultural cooperative (played by buxom Sandra Milo) eagerly awaits her pen pal Adolfo (the ever-reliable FranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ois PÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rier), a librarian from Rome. She has invited him to spend a Sunday in her Lombardy village. This could easily have become a predictable, complacent confrontation between the cultured man from the big city and the unsophisticated country lass. But the film has something else in store ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a wonderful reflection on the volatile nature of intimacy, and a touching exploration of the question of maintaining one's romantic integrity in the face of disappointment and the duplicity of emotions. In the course of this day, Pina discovers that Adolfo is far from being the decent, sympathetic man his letters had promised: There is something arrogant and downright mean about the way he takes her hospitality for granted and revels in her presumed emotional and erotic availability. Each new sequence reveals yet another obnoxious trait of his ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he makes racist remarks, gradually loses his manners, makes a pass at the underage girl next door and embarrasses Pina in front of her neighbors by drinking way too much Lambrusco. When she sensitively confronts him with his foibles at the end of the day, a deeper level of understanding suddenly seems possible. He almost feels relieved by her shrewd assessment of his faults. A delicate moment of catharsis: It is as if she, by struggling to maintain her own dignity, restores some of his as well. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img16.imageshack.us/img16/2438/bscap0002p.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img16.imageshack.us/img16/2438/bscap0002p.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img26.imageshack.us/img26/6051/bscap0005c.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img26.imageshack.us/img26/6051/bscap0005c.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img14.imageshack.us/img14/3975/bscap0013z.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img14.imageshack.us/img14/3975/bscap0013z.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n--------not my rip---------\n\n~~~~~~ La visita.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n\n                                                               \n\nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,468,542,976                     \n\n                                                                                \n\n--- Video Information ---                                                       \n\nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \n\nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:46:08                \n\nFrame Count:....................................159176             \n\nFrame Width (pixels):...........................720                  \n\nFrame Height (pixels):..........................432                  \n\nAspect Ratio:...................................1.667                     \n\nFrames Per Second:..............................25.000          \n\nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1614                 \n\n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \n\nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.208&quot;                     \n\n                                                                                \n\n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \n\nAudio Codec:....................................0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3                   \n\nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \n\nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................224                 \n\nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \n\nAudio Channel Count:............................2                    \n\n\n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
