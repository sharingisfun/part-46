Airing from 1955 to 1957 and hosted by Truman Bradley, Science Fiction Theatre's seventy-eight episodes presented its intelligent and fantastic stories in an anthology format.\r\n\r\nMy notes\r\n\r\n  This was a recent acquisition of my library.  They are half hour episodes and there's a wiki for the details.\r\n\r\n  But the wiki or synopses cannot describe this picture of the 1950's adequately except in the viewing.  SFT is an unique blend of science fact such as the children's program Mr Wizard with Don Herbert provided for youngsters and science fiction 'from the edge of tomorrow' as the show puts it.\r\n\r\n  In it's 78 episodes most every familiar face from television appears.  If you remember that time you can play along and either remember or wait for the credits to see the names.  Vera Miles appears in one.  And Marie Windsor with Don Defore.  Warren Stevens from &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; {but not Jack Kelly or Ann Francis).\r\n\r\n  Concurrent with my viewings of SFT,  I was watching the Tribune Company's new series &quot;Manhattan&quot;'  It is both a contrast and a parallel \r\nviewing experience to see the period costumes in Manhattan and the every day dress in SFT.\r\n\r\n  Your host Truman Bradley will tell you that &quot;This has been a story of fiction, it did not happen&quot;.  But it is indeed hard to believe that the mention of LSD occurs in one episode of a program made in the mid 1950's.\r\n\r\n  Imagine being a youngster who goes into science because of such a show.  I can, but I was maybe a year or two too young to have that effect.  I would have been eight or nine.\r\n\r\n  SFT is available as a full DVD box.  It is a worthwhile collection to have as historical material for a time when science was at the forefront of the American imagination and in the Cold War.\r\n\r\n   It is available from Timeless Media Group,  the same company which released &quot;Johnny Staccato&quot;  with John Cassavetes (also in my collection of fileshares.)\r\n\r\n   I will do this as single episodes.  The disclaimer tells us that these transfers were made from the best available media.  You will see some variation as the series progresses.\r\n\r\n   See the wiki for more on this captivating series and share with others on your indexes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7d9e4ae307aedd71af4f775f93d447ea6bf7fc2","amp;dn":"Science+Fiction+Theatre+%281955%29+s01e11","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7d9e4ae307aedd71af4f775f93d447ea6bf7fc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,217,228,174,48,122,237,215,26,244,247,117,249,61,68,126,166,191,127,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
