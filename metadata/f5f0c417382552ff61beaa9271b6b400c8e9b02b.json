Over ten episodes Martin travels to different regions in the UK - Devon, New Forest, Norfolk, Yorkshire, Northumberland, Angus, Trossachs, the Lakes and Pembrokeshire. Along the way he meets growers, fisherman, farmers, larger-than-life local experts and fellow holiday makers. Martin cooks for his new-found friends, creating local dishes from his small campervan kitchen. These feasts unfold wherever Martin camps up, in some truly stunning settings: on Britain's beaches, in woodlands, on cliff tops and around intimate campfires. Martin unearths our freshest seasonal food, tasting his way around Britain on this campervan food adventure.\n\n\n1)  Devon \nMartin begins his journey in his home county of Devon. Here, he finds a stunning beach to park up for the night, fishes for his lunch, has to beat the tide to pick the perfect mussels, tries to master an egg banjo sandwich and is in danger of all his hard work being washed away at the very last minute.\n\n2)  New Forest \nIn this episode Martin travels to the New Forest. As he prepares a forager's dinner, he meets up with a local expert who takes him deep into the forest and teaches him how to spot a good mushroom from one that can kill you. For his next meal, Martin must overcome the attentions of a rather amorous goat as he attempts to make a French delicacy with a campervan twist.\n\n3)  Norfolk \nIn Norfolk, Martin gets knee deep in crab-infested mud to pick fresh samphire for his lunch. For his campervan dinner in a cider-producing orchard, he creates a taste of the Australian outback.\n\n4)  Yorkshire \nThis stage of Martin's tour of Britain takes him to the Yorkshire Dales. Here he finds a rather surprising bird that lays giant eggs and a farmer who makes chorizo sausage, Yorkshire style. But a campervan accident means a trip to the local hospital and the whole trip is put in jeopardy\n\n5)  Northumberland \nMartin's campervan adventure continues in Northumberland. It's an early start on Holy Island and he has to beat the tide to join local fishermen Sean and Richard on a quest to pick up fresh lobster for a campervan feast.\n\n6)  Angus \nMartin's campervan adventure has crossed the border into Scotland. With the help of a local expert, he tries his hand at traditional barrel-smoked Arbroath smokies for his dinner.\n\n7)  Trossachs \nThis time, Martin and his campervan are in the glorious Trossachs National Park. Scottish brown trout is on the menu, if Martin can get to grips with fishing - in an inflatable armchair.\n\n8)  Lake District \nMartin explores the Lake District in his classic campervan. He attempts to scale the treacherous Wrynose Pass, meets an angry wild boar and heads off road in search of the mysterious bilberry for an 'oven free' clotted cream tea.\n\n9)  Caldicot \nThe food adventure continues in Wales. A campervan festival creates the opportunity for both Martin's 70s classic camper and his Welsh lamb campervan curry to face the judges\n\n10)  Pembrokeshire \nThe final leg of Martin's 2500-mile campervan trip around the UK finishes in Pembrokeshire. He rustles up a foraged flower cordial and gets the whole family involved in creating campervan burgers. But could the trip end sooner that he expected?\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img600.imageshack.us/img600/4822/od3p.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img600.imageshack.us/img600/4822/od3p.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img30.imageshack.us/img30/4799/wcfq.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img30.imageshack.us/img30/4799/wcfq.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img404.imageshack.us/img404/3894/gjnk.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img404.imageshack.us/img404/3894/gjnk.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/4433/twrh.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/4433/twrh.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/7858/6qs8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/7858/6qs8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/3134/pkhs.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/3134/pkhs.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img600.imageshack.us/img600/6531/u7vc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img600.imageshack.us/img600/6531/u7vc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/7613/mn38.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/7613/mn38.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img513.imageshack.us/img513/4981/ufg4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img513.imageshack.us/img513/4981/ufg4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;9bd6faf2f5dbd7a8b5ab&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 1345 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video: Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 29mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 10\n * Part Size: average 264 MB\n * Container: Mp4\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00yndpc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00yndpc&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5f0c417382552ff61beaa9271b6b400c8e9b02b","amp;dn":"One+Man+And+His+Campervan+03of10+Norfolk+DVDRip+x264+AAC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5f0c417382552ff61beaa9271b6b400c8e9b02b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,240,196,23,56,37,82,255,97,190,170,146,113,182,180,0,200,233,176,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
