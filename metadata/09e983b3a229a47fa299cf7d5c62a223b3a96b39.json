Starting from the widget theme, allowing you to change colors, widget spacings and icon sizes to custom tool sets in the toolbox. The interface is modulized into so called docks, allowing you to stack them into tabs or keep them open in their own window.\nPressing the tab key will toggle them hidden.\n\nGIMP features a great fullscreen mode allowing you to not only preview your artwork but also do editing work while using the most of your screen estate.\n\nPhoto Enhancement\n\nNumerous digital photo imperfections can be easily compensated for using GIMP.\nFix perspective distortion caused by lens tilt simply choosing the corrective mode in the transform tools. Eliminate lens' barrel distortion and vignetting with a powerful filter but a simple interface.\n\nThe included channel mixer gives you the flexibility and power to get your B/W photography stand out the way you need.\n\nDigital Retouching\n\nGIMP is ideal for advanced photo retouching techniques.\nGet rid of unneeded details using the clone tool, or touch up minor details easily with the new healing tool. With the perspective clone tool, it's not difficult to clone objects with perspective in mind just as easily as with the orthogonal clone.\n\nHardware Support\n\nGIMP includes a very unique support for various input devices out of the box. Pressure and tilt sensitive tablets, but also a wide range of USB or MIDI controllers. You can bind often-used actions to device events such as rotating a USB wheel or moving a MIDI controller's slider.\nChange the size, angle or opacity of a brush while you paint, bind your favorite scripts to buttons. Speed up your workflow!\n\nFile Formats\n\nThe file format support ranges from the common likes of JPEG (JFIF), GIF, PNG, TIFF to special use formats such as the multi-resolution and multi-color-depth Windows icon files. The architecture allows to extend GIMP's format capabilities with a plug-in. You can find some rare format support in the GIMP plugin registry.\n\nThanks to the transparent virtual file system, it is possible to load and save files to from remote locations using protocols such as FTP, HTTP or even SMB (MS Windows shares) and SFTP/SSH.\n\nTo save disk space, any format can be saved with an archive extension such as ZIP, GZ or BZ2 and GIMP will transparently compress the file without you needing to do any extra steps.\n\nSupported Operating Systems:\nMicrosoft Windows (2000, XP, Vista)\n\n\nComments from the uploader (olofolleola4):\nThe following file formats are supported:\n\nGIMP XCF Picture: *.xcf\nAlias Pix Picture: *.pix, *.matte, *.mask, *.alpha\nAutoDesk FLIC-animation: *.fli, *.flc\nBZip-archive: *.xcf.bz2, *.bz2, *.xcfbz2\nDICOM-picture: *.dcm, *.dicom\nPostscript picture: *.eps\nFlexible Image Transport System: *.fit, *.fits\nG3 Fax Image: *.g3\nGIF-picture: *.gif\nGIMP-pattern: *.pat\nGIMP-pencil: *.gbr, *.gpb\nGIMP-pencil (animated): *.gih\nGZip-archive: *.xcf.gz, *.gz, *.xcfgz\nJPEG-picture: *.jpg, *.jpeg, *.jpe\nKISS CEL: *.cel\nMicrosoft Windows Icon: *.ico\nMicrosoft WMF-file: *.wmf, *.apm\nPaint Shop Pro Picture: *.psp, *.tub, *.pspimage\nPhotoshop-picture: *.psd\nPNG-picture: *.png\nPNM-picture: *.pnm, *.ppm, *.pgm, *.pbm\nPortable Document Format: *.pdf\nPostScript-document: *.ps\nSilicion Graphics IRIS-picture: *.sgi, *.rgb, *.bw, *.icon\nDesktoplink: *.desktop\nSUN rasterfile-picture: *.im1, *.im8, *.im24, *.im32\nSVG-picture: *.svg\nTarga-picture: *.tga, *.vda, *.icb, *.vst\nTIFF-picture: *.tif, *.tiff\nWindows BMP-picture: *.bmp\nX-window dump: *.xwd\nX bitmap-picture: *.xbm, *.icon, *.bitmap\nX pixmap-picture: *.xpm\nZSoft PCX-picture: *.pcx, *.pcc","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09e983b3a229a47fa299cf7d5c62a223b3a96b39","amp;dn":"The+GIMP+2.6.6+%2B+GTK%2B+2.16.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09e983b3a229a47fa299cf7d5c62a223b3a96b39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,233,131,179,162,41,164,127,162,153,207,125,92,98,162,35,179,169,107,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
