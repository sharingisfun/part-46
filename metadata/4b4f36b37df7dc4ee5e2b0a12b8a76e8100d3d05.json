Smith's Shazam! miniseries, in the works since 2003, is a more traditional take on the character, returning Captain Marvel to his roots with a story that updates the character's history for today's readers. It is set early on in the character's career however, as it is clearly not set in the modern day DCU. In this version, Mr. Mind resembles a small snake with a more threatening face with apparently perfect vision while wearing a modern style communicator headset. Many different monsters are shown in the Society, with the Crocodile men becoming Alligator Men.\nEnjoy and Seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b4f36b37df7dc4ee5e2b0a12b8a76e8100d3d05","amp;dn":"Shazam%21-The+Monster+Society+of+Evil","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b4f36b37df7dc4ee5e2b0a12b8a76e8100d3d05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,79,54,179,125,247,220,78,229,226,176,161,43,138,118,232,16,13,61,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
