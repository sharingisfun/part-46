We do however strongly recommend using a dedicated 3D graphics card with a chipset from AMD or NVIDIA. Currently, powerful graphics chips are also available on mid-range notebooks.\nAlways make sure to use the latest drivers. Newer drivers are usually faster and more stable.\nIf you're looking for speed comparisons, conduct a search for CINEBENCH scores on the internet.\nDisclaimer: MAXON cannot be held liable for the compatibility of specific graphics cards with the Enhanced OpenGL mode. Due to the amount of possible combinations of graphic chipsets, operating systems and driver revisions, it is impossible to guarantee the operation on all systems. Also, technical specifications in MAXON products are subject to change. Please use the most current demo version of CINEMA 4D oder BodyPaint 3D to test the compatibilty on a specific system.\n \n\nA Word About NVIDIA 3D Vision\n\nIf you intend to use NVIDIA's 3D Vision shutter glasses for your stereoscopic experience please note that a quad buffered graphics card is required for use in conjunction with CINEMA 4D.\nA list of graphics cards that support the neccesary features can be found at NVIDIA's website:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nvidia.com/object/quadro_pro_graphics_boards.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nvidia.com/object/quadro_pro_graphics_boards.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\noriginal site: http://www.maxon.net/en/home.html\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCINEMA 4D STUDIO - EVERYTHING YOU NEED FOR HIGH-END 3D\n\n\nCINEMA 4D Studio is the very best that MAXON has to offer for professional 3D artists.
