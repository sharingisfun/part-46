This time though, Spidey has help from a rather unexpected source. Not the fanciest story, but this pure beat-em-up goodness is pretty fun to read still, with some great art especially in the action scenes. This digital copy is provided by Minutemen-InnderDemons, so thanks to them. Enjoy and please seed! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19b69e22b0c5676b53429901c2eb60e9cb86c45b","amp;dn":"The+Amazing+Spider-Man+334-339+%281990%2C+Digital%2C+MM-ID%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19b69e22b0c5676b53429901c2eb60e9cb86c45b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,182,158,34,176,197,103,107,83,66,153,1,194,235,96,233,203,134,196,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
