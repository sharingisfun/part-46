Bodycall's style has been constantly evolving towards its today's formula, which can be described as harsh but melodic synth lines with strong beat and aggressive (but much cleaner than it is normally the case in this genre) vocals. \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œReiterationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ consists of brand new versions of Bodycall's songs and two previously unpublished compositions. This material is a kind of side effect that sprouted out of various experiments the band is undertaking during the work on its new full length release. \n\nEven though the songs featuring on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œReiterationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ come from a wide time span (2003 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2010) the release is consistent and all the music has been written from scratch during first months of 2010. The style is dark electro and aggrotech or electro-industrial. Those who are not purists and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œold school onlyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ fans can spot some EBM elements and inspirations as well.\n\n\n\n*************************************************************************\nSounds similiar to: \nAgonoize, Amduscia, Apoptygma Berzerk, Assemblage 23, Blutengel, Combichrist, Covenant, Das Ich, Dawn of Ashes, Deine Lakaien, Diary of Dreams, Dioxyde, Dulce Liquido, Feindflug, FGFC820, Front 242, Front Line Assembly, Funker Vogt, God Module, Grendel, GGFH, Hocico, Icon of Coil, In Strict Confidence, Panzer AG, Project Pitchfork, Psyclon Nine, Reaper, Rotersand, Spetsnaz, Suicide Commando, Tactical Sekt, Unter Null, Velvet Acid Christ, VNV Nation, Wolfsheim, Wumpscut, Wynardtage, x-Fusion.\t\n*************************************************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37cd6b2b2eaac19637f977070db832d65041af68","amp;dn":"Bodycall-Reiteration+%282010%29+dark+electro+aggrotech+industrial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37cd6b2b2eaac19637f977070db832d65041af68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,205,107,43,46,170,193,150,55,249,119,7,13,184,50,214,80,65,175,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
