With the release of the 24th official James Bond film, Spectre, we ask - which 007 is the best? To date, six actors have portrayed British Secret Service agent James Bond. Was Sean Connery impossible to surpass? Was George Lazenby really that bad? Was Live and Let Die really a blaxploitation movie in disguise? Gatiss and Sweet consider these and many other questions, and raise a martini in honour of their premium Bond.\r\n_______________________________________________\r\n \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02sx893\r\n\r\n1280x720 resolution, with subtitles - enjoy !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d83fb64551f3aec4b79b92d86341eb967a212b2","amp;dn":"Premium.Bond.with.M.Gatiss.and.M.Sweet--BBC-2015-720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d83fb64551f3aec4b79b92d86341eb967a212b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,131,251,100,85,31,58,236,75,121,185,45,134,52,30,185,103,162,18,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
