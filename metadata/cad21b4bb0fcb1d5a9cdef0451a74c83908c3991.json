It is often translated as control of the life force. When used as a technical term in yoga, it is often translated more specifically as &quot;breath control.&quot; For current students of yoga, our app can help you improve your technique without much conscious effort, so that you can focus your mind purely on breathing and technique. It is a portable, customizable tool that will take your practice of yoga to the next level.
