Pitching \nhas been simplified from 2K8 to &quot;2-step pitching&quot;, with &quot;hold and gesture&quot;, \neliminating the third &quot;Release Timing&quot; step of 2K8, simplifying the motion \nwhile retaining the style. &quot;Meatballs&quot; (mistake pitches) have been removed - \ninstead, badly released pitches will be less effective (fastballs will be \nstraighter, curveballs will hang, and so forth.) The AI's pitch selection was \nalso improved. (Players may elect to use the third step as an option, and users \nmay also still use the older Precision Pitching from 2K7.) &quot;Influence hitting&quot; \nallows users to control fly and ground balls, improved bunting, zone hitting \nfeature, improved hit distribution, while the game improved fielding realism \nand AI, with the ability to cancel a throw and hold the ball, as well as pump \nfake during a rundown. A player can also attempt a &quot;Quick Throw&quot; which gets \nthe ball to a base faster but also increases the chance of an error.Baserunning \ncontrol has been simplified; a player only needs to hold down the trigger until \nit vibrates, for instance, to steal a base. There are also separate &quot;Steal&quot; \nratings for runners in addition to Speed.\n\nThe ballpark realism has been increased as well. Players will move from the \ndugout to the batterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s box and from the bullpen to the mound, warm up by \nthrowing around the horn, bat swinging practice, run out to their positions, \nand so forth. Umpires, ball boys and coaches will perform their actions, while \nvendors and fans perform and react realistically; for example, foul balls will \ncause people in the crowd to jump out of their seats and try to catch the ball. \nStadiums will have their unique fan signatures; for example, Turner Field will \nhave the Tomahawk Chop while Tropicana Field will have the Cow Bell. Players \nwill react properly to such events as a walkoff home run, a no-hitter or a \nWorld Series celebration. There are also 300 new Signature Style animations. \nRain delays have also been mentioned.\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tSTEP 1:\t\tExtract file with 7z to anywhere you like.\n\t\t\t(note: Game will install to 'OS': Games MLB_2K9)\n\n\n\tSTEP 2:\t\tDouble click 'setup.exe' in 'Baseball' folder.\n\n\n\tSTEP 3:\t\tFollow on screen instructions!\n\t\t\t*DO NOT INTERRUPT PROCESS ONCE EXTRACTION HAS BEGUN*\n\n\t\n\tSTEP 4:\t\tStart game from Desktop. \n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tN'Joy!\n\n\n\nFreeman G Ripper\n\n\n\nI highly recommend you go check out the following sites: \n\n\twww.davidicke.com\n\twww.cuttingthroughthematrix.com\n\ttracker.conspiracycentral.net\n\n\ncheck out the forums!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a5fd0c367a562fc7d76157e85b4f5c4137b33ed","amp;dn":"Major+League+Baseball+2K9+-+PC+Rip+by+Freeman+G+Ripper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a5fd0c367a562fc7d76157e85b4f5c4137b33ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,95,208,195,103,165,98,252,125,118,21,126,133,180,245,196,19,123,51,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
