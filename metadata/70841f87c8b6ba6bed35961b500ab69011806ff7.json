His passionate and painstaking research reveals truths more fascinating than the myths that have long shrouded the maestro's life. Here is the archetypal child prodigy whose genius triumphed over early precociousness, and who later broke away from a loving but tyrannical father to pursue his vision unhampered.\n\nPeter Gay's Mozart traces the legendary development of the man whose life was a whirlwind of achievement, and the composer who pushed every instrument to its limit and every game -- especially opera -- into new realms.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70841f87c8b6ba6bed35961b500ab69011806ff7","amp;dn":"Mozart+-+Peter+Gay++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70841f87c8b6ba6bed35961b500ab69011806ff7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,132,31,135,200,182,186,107,237,53,150,27,80,10,182,144,17,128,111,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
