It will be the\nfirst release on the band's Richter Scale imprint in conjunction with Justice\nRecords.\n\nThe tracks &quot;Bells of Creation&quot; and &quot;Inland Sea,&quot; which re-establish the dark,\npunishing rock of classics like 2002's &quot;Source Tags &amp; Codes,&quot; have already been\npreviewed on the &quot;Festival Thyme&quot; EP.\n\nOther highlights include &quot;Pictures of an Only Child,&quot; which begins as a subdued\nwash of sound before bursting into a loud, chugging chorus; the bracing &quot;Far\nPavilions,&quot; with shouted counterpoint vocals from drummer Jason Reece; and\n&quot;Fields of Coal,&quot; which has an inspirational chorus almost in the vein of an old\nfield worker's song.\n\nElsewhere, acoustic guitar and piano carry &quot;Luna Park,&quot; while &quot;Insatiable&quot; is\nmostly frontman Conrad Keely and piano. &quot;The Century of Self&quot; was produced by\nChris Coady (TV On The Radio, Yeah Yeah Yeahs) and features backing vocal\ncontributions from members of Yeasayer and Dragons Of Zynth.\n\n&quot;On the last two albums, we were really meticulous recording to click-tracks and\ndoing overdubs,&quot; Keely told Billboard in August. &quot;This time, we threw all that\nout. We learned the songs and all tracked live.&quot;\n\nA longtime Austin resident, Keely moved to New York a couple years ago and\nquickly found himself inspired by local bands such as Yeasayer and Dirty\nProjectors. &quot;Suddenly I was almost overloaded with all this new music, and\nwondering how we could come close to matching it?,&quot; he says. &quot;That inspiration\ncame into a lot of the writing.&quot;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:165f352bd16cab345db3c2c35c3f152ac03dd43c","amp;dn":"And_You_Will_Know_Us_By_The_Trail_Of_Dead-The_Century_Of_Self-%28A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"165f352bd16cab345db3c2c35c3f152ac03dd43c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,95,53,43,209,108,171,52,93,179,194,195,92,63,21,42,192,61,212,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
