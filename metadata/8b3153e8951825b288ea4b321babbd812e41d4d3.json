On the case, he soon deducts that the killer, who staged the murder to look like a random robbery, may actually be a serial killer Terry was trailing for years in the FBI. Can the elderly and feeble McCaleb, who had intended to spend his retirement living on his boat in the Los Angeles harbor, and who can't drive, and has to nap regularly, muster up the endurance to find the killer?\n\nFeel free to comment or contact me &amp; suprbay(Same user name as here) \n                     \n4mbit home line seeded, enjoy! =)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b3153e8951825b288ea4b321babbd812e41d4d3","amp;dn":"Blood+Work%5B2002%5DDvDrip%5BEng%5D+HarrHarrr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b3153e8951825b288ea4b321babbd812e41d4d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,49,83,232,149,24,37,178,136,234,75,50,27,171,189,129,46,65,212,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
