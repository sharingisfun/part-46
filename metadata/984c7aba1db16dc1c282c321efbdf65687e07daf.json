Rolling, voluptuous basslines, uptight guitars, and vibrant brass sections drive tracks like George Clinton&amp;#039;s &quot;Atomic Dog,&quot; Slave&amp;#039;s &quot;Watching You,&quot; and Con Funk Shun&amp;#039;s &quot;Chase Me,&quot; bridging the gap between funk and disco and providing countless rap and hip-hop artists ample material for sampling. Madame X&amp;#039;s &quot;Just That Type of Girl,&quot; Otis Redding&amp;#039;s &quot;Tramp,&quot; and the Time&amp;#039;s &quot;777-9311&quot; are among the other highlights of this funky, stylish compilation, which also documents just how integral these songs were to hip-hop&amp;#039;s development.\n\n\n\n\n01.
