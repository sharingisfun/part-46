Yet an astringent critic such as Leavis accounted The Vanity of Human Wishes a great poem, while Eliot declared both it and London  to be amongst the greatest verse satires in English or any other language. He also wrote &quot;If lines 189-220 of The Vanity of Human Wishes are not poetry, I do not know what is.&quot;Ã‚Â  \n\nThis is from the Penguin Audiobook of Eighteenth Century Verse. I have added an interesting reading by John Ricchetti from the UPenn Poetry site Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not a professional voice but nonetheless a civilised one. Kindly seed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0230fadac0a5da9401ea84709eb863abd3a87357","amp;dn":"Samuel+Johnson+-+%27The+Vanity+of+Human+Wishes%27+-+Penguin+Audioboo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0230fadac0a5da9401ea84709eb863abd3a87357","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,48,250,218,192,165,218,148,1,234,132,112,158,184,99,171,211,168,115,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
