Four months later, on April 28 at 7:01am, Pasquale and his expedition partner Gordon Brown, reached the mouth of the Nile at the Mediterranean Sea, becoming the first in history to complete this 3,250-mile journey. Their amazing journey is the basis for the IMAX film, MYSTERY OF THE NILE.\n\nThe epic 3,250 mile descent down the world's greatest and deadliest river has eluded humankind for centuries - until now! Ride shotgun on the team's 16-foot rafts as they crash through the rapids in Ethiopia's desert canyons. Battle through some of the world's most extreme whitewater rapids with renowned kayaker, Gordon Brown. \n\nOver the arduous, four month journey, the team faces nearly in-surmountable challenges - from crocodile attacks to armed bandits and arrests. Through breathtaking cinematography, Mystery of the Nile reveals a wondrous region and abundant treasures, from Tissisat Falls and the wonders of Egypt to the forgotten black pyramids of Meroe and 12th century churches that were carved into sheer rock.\n\nMYSTERY OF THE NILE tells the story of this emotional and historic expedition while also exploring the cultural and environmental links between the Ethiopian, Sudanese and Egyptian civilizations. Both a captivating human adventure and a serious in-depth look at this most fascinating yet little-known region, MYSTERY OF THE NILE promises another exciting and educational giant screen experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nHRHDTV.\n\nFile Size: 999 MB\nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 00:47:40\nVideo Codec:Divx6\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nVIdeo Bitrate: 2856 kbit/s\nAudio Bitrate: 164 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: MPEG Layer -3 (AC3)\nAudio Channels: 2\nSubtitles:(N/A)\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0444673/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0444673/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e3293971e80bb6672f4aac3f2d9f22c9017176e","amp;dn":"Mystery+Of+The+Nile-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e3293971e80bb6672f4aac3f2d9f22c9017176e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,50,147,151,30,128,187,102,114,244,170,195,242,217,242,44,144,23,23,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
