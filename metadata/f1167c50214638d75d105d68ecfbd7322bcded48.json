One of the key figures of the Wars of the Roses, daughter of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville, she married Henry Tudor to bring peace to a war-torn England. In Elizabeth of York: The First Tudor Queen, Alison Weir builds a portrait of this beloved queen, placing her in the context of the magnificent, ceremonious, often brutal world she inhabited.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1167c50214638d75d105d68ecfbd7322bcded48","amp;dn":"Elizabeth+of+York+-+Alison+Weir++%282013+-+Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1167c50214638d75d105d68ecfbd7322bcded48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,22,124,80,33,70,56,215,93,16,93,104,236,251,215,50,43,205,237,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
