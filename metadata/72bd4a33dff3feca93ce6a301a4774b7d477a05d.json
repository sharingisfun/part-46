Looking to transition from her &quot;darker and more urban&quot; fifth studio album Blackout (2007), Spears wanted to make her next project &quot;a little bit lighter&quot;, incorporating pop and dance-pop styles. Spears recorded the record during the summer of 2008, after her much-publicized personal struggles saw her placement under a temporary conservatorship earlier that year. As executive producers, Larry Rudolph and Teresa LaBarbera Whites enlisted collaborators including Spears' longtime colleague Max Martin and Danja. \nTracklist:\n1.Womanizer\n2.Circus\n3.Out From Under\n4.Kill The Lights\n5.Shattered Glass\n6.If U Seek Amy\n7.Unusual You\n8.Blur\n9.MMM Papi\n10.Mannequin\n11.Lace And Leather\n12.My Baby\n13.Radar (Bonus Track)\n14.Rock Me In (Bonus Track)\n15.Phonography (Bonus Track)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72bd4a33dff3feca93ce6a301a4774b7d477a05d","amp;dn":"Britney+Spears+Circus+%28Deluxe+CD+Rip%29+MusicFanatic98","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72bd4a33dff3feca93ce6a301a4774b7d477a05d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,189,74,51,223,243,254,202,147,206,106,48,26,71,116,183,212,119,160,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
