His master is a trainer of animals for the gladiatorial arena, and Rufus discovers that he has a natural talent for controlling the animals. It is at the arenas that Rufus meets his great friend Cupido, one of RomeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s greatest gladiators. His growing reputation as an animal trainer and his friendship with Cupido attracts the cruel gaze of the Emperor. Rufus is bought from his master and taken to the imperial palace. Intrigue permeates his court, and Rufus and Cupido find themselves at the centre of a conspiracy to assassinate Caligula. But can a slave decide the fate of an Emperor?\n\n \nAbout The Author\nDouglas Jackson was born in Jedburgh in the Scottish borders and now lives in Bridge of Allan.
