Themes from the Philosophy of Robert Stalnaker&quot;, Oxford University Press 2006.\n\nThe material is of interest of philosophers, AI recsearches on Conditional event, logicians with face conditionals by three-valued or relevant logics. \n\nThe issue at stake is whether conditionals are ordinary propositions or they require some kind of partial logic or completely lack of truth values.\n\nThe material is interesting especially because Lycan in his book &quot;Real Conditionals&quot; did not deal with the kind of theories the paper in the file is concerned. This may be considered as an addendum tothat book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb0ac486d8f73e440f056c318dbcc4c19f3ccd08","amp;dn":"Willliam+G.+Lycan+-+Conditional-Assertion+Theories+of+Conditiona","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb0ac486d8f73e440f056c318dbcc4c19f3ccd08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,10,196,134,216,247,62,68,15,5,108,49,141,188,196,193,159,60,205,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
