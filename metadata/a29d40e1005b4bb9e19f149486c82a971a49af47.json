The answer is that no, death is not necessary, inevitable, or good. In fact, death is wrong. Death is the enemy of us all, to be fought with medicine, science, and technology. This book introduces you to the greatest, most challenging, most revolutionary movement to radically extend human lifespans so that you might not have to die at all.\n\nYou will learn about some amazingly long-lived plants and animals, recent scientific discoveries that point the way toward lengthening lifespans in humans, and simple, powerful arguments that can overcome the common excuses for death. If you have ever thought that death is unjust and should be defeated, you are not alone. Read this book, and become part of the most important quest in human history.\n\nThis book was written by the philosopher and futurist Gennady Stolyarov II and illustrated by the artist Wendy Stolyarov. It is here to show you that, no matter who you are and what you can do, there is always a way for you to help in humanityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s struggle against death.\n\n&quot;I thought the book was fun to read and important in what it tries to accomplish.&quot; - Zoltan Istvan, Psychology Today\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a29d40e1005b4bb9e19f149486c82a971a49af47","amp;dn":"Death+is+Wrong+by+Gennady+Stolyarov+II","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a29d40e1005b4bb9e19f149486c82a971a49af47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,157,64,225,0,91,75,185,225,159,20,148,134,200,42,151,26,73,175,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
