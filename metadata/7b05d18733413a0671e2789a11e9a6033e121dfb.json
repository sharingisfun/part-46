Only a whisper lingers from those who have come across him.\n\nThe Bandy Man...\nA tale of God's first and unfinished creation.\n\n\nIssues 1-3 of 'The Bandy Man'\n\nCaliber Comics, 1996-1997\n\nWritten by Stefan Petrucha\n\nIllustrated by Charlie Adlard, Nate Pride, Jill Thompson, Miran Kim\n\n\n\nThis one goes deep, dark and philosophical, mostly about creation. Each issue also contains a three-page text piece at the end, also about creation. I remember really enjoying both parts of the book when I read it.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b05d18733413a0671e2789a11e9a6033e121dfb","amp;dn":"The+Bandy+Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b05d18733413a0671e2789a11e9a6033e121dfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,5,209,135,51,65,58,6,113,226,120,154,17,233,166,3,62,18,29,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
