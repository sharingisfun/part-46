It introduces the theoretical background to a number of techniques and general data analysis techniques. The book also examines the application of techniques in an industrial setting, including current practices and current research, are presented. It provides practical experience of commercially available systems and includes a small-scale water systems related projects.\n\nThe authors illustrate the concepts and techniques covered in the book by using a calculation that simulates water distribution networks and water transmission systems. The book also covers significant research on new methodologies and important applications in the fields of automation and control as well as includes the latest coverage of chemical databases and the development of new computational methods and efficient algorithms for hydraulic software and mechanical engineering.\n\nThe book will be informative and useful to both academics and mechanical engineers in various industrial sectors, including hydraulic and mechanical engineering.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nKaveh Hariri Asli, PhD, is a professional mechanical engineer with over 30 years of experience in practicing mechanical engineering design and teaching. He is the author of over 50 articles and reports in the fields of fluid mechanics, hydraulics, automation, and control systems. Dr. Hariri has consulted for a number of major corporations.\n\nHossein Sahleh, PhD, is a university lecturer with 30 years of experience in teaching and research in mathematics. He is the author of many papers in journals and conference proceedings and is on the editorial board member of several journals.\n\nHossein Sahleh, PhD, is a university lecturer with 30 years of experience in teaching and research in mathematics.
