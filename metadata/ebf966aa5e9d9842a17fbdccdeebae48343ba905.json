I see it hasn't surfaced yet.\n\n2HD has been pretty good at filling in the holes as episodes repeat, so cross your fingers they will catch it someday.\n\nAnyhow, due to the serious subject nature of the episode (suicide), Much held a discussion forum afterwards with cast and fans discussing the episode.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebf966aa5e9d9842a17fbdccdeebae48343ba905","amp;dn":"MuchTalks.Degrassi.2013-02-22.HDTV.x264-CLDD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebf966aa5e9d9842a17fbdccdeebae48343ba905","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,249,102,170,94,157,152,66,161,127,189,204,222,235,174,72,52,59,169,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
