This is the dramatic story of sixty-eight soldiers of the U.S. ArmyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2nd Ranger Battalion, D CompanyÃ¢â‚¬â€Dog CompanyÃ¢â‚¬â€who made that difference, time and again.\n\nFrom D-Day, when German guns atop Pointe du Hoc threatened the Allied landings and the men of Dog Company scaled the ninety-foot cliffs to destroy them; to the thickly forested slopes of Hill 400, in GermanyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s HÃƒÂ¼rtgen Forest, where the Rangers launched a desperate bayonet charge across an open field, captured the crucial hill, and held it against all odds. In each battle, the men of Dog Company made the difference.\n\nDog Company is their unforgettable storyÃ¢â‚¬â€thoroughly researched and vividly told by acclaimed combat historian Patrick K. OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢DonnellÃ¢â‚¬â€a story of extraordinary bravery, courage, and determination. America had many heroes in World War II, but few can say that, but for them, the course of the war may have been very different. The right men, in the right place, at the right timeÃ¢â‚¬â€Dog Company.\n\nKirkus Reviews\nInspiring story of the Army's 2nd Ranger Battalion, Company D (&quot;Dog Company&quot;), from battle historian O'Donnell (Give Me Tomorrow: The Korean War's Greatest Untold Story--The Epic Stand of the Marines of George Company, 2010, etc.). The 200-plus volunteers who made up the initial complement of Dog Company assembled at Fort Meade in March 1943. The author has worked with veterans of the unit--e.g., the late Len Lomell and other &quot;great Ranger friends&quot;--to trace survivors and organize their stories and memories into the Drop Zone Oral History Project, which provides one of the sources for this book. The soldiers were trained to assault and capture high points from the sea, and the cliffs and heavy gun emplacements at Pointe du Hoc were their target from the beginning. The assignment was considered to be &quot;a suicide mission,&quot; and top officials &quot;projected casualties would top 70 percent.&quot; O'Donnell engagingly describes how a dedicated team was built out of the specialist training it received, but he is at his best presenting the fortunes and shocks of battle as the months of planning and training were blown away in a series of mischances that also fortuitously safeguarded the unit from delayed pre-invasion bombing runs. The author also highlights the courage of Ranger Lt. Bob Edlin and his three companions, who organized &quot;the unbelievably audacious bluff&quot; that secured the surrender of the German garrison of the Lochrist Gun Battery at Brest in August 1944. A worthy tribute honoring each member of a small group of volunteers who responded to the call of duty.\n\nProduct Details\nISBN-13: 9780306820298\nPublisher: Da Capo Press\nPublication date: 11/6/2012\nPages: 288","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dd6277d2265d0fc53268808f7a01a4231afd373","amp;dn":"Patrick+K.+O%27Donnell+-+Dog+Company+%282012%29+%5B96%5D+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dd6277d2265d0fc53268808f7a01a4231afd373","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,214,39,125,34,101,208,252,83,38,136,8,247,160,26,66,49,175,211,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
