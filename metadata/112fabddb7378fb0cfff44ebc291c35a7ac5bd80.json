Very few problems require the ability of\n    forming and solving equations and the simplest at that.\n    The table of contents, as you may see, is quite diversified: the\n    subjects range from a motley collection of conundrums and mathematical stunts to useful practical prob]enls on counting and measuring.\n    The author has done everything to make his book as fresh as possible,\n    avoiding repetition of all that has already appeared in his othe\u001fr\n    works (Tricks and Amusements, Interesting Problems, etc.). The\n    reader will find a hundred or so brain-teasers that have not been\n    included in earlier books. Chapter VI - &quot;Number Giants&quot; - is\n    adapted from one of the author's earlier pamphlets, with four new\n    stories added.\n\nThis edition was published by Foreign Languages Publishing House, published perhaps in the 1950s. The book was translated from the Russian by G. Ivanov-Mumjiev and was designed by D. Bistt.\n\n\nAll credits to the original uploader.\n\n======================================\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n=+                                  +=\n=+ Released on TPB by mirtitles.org +=\n=+                                  +=\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n======================================\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:112fabddb7378fb0cfff44ebc291c35a7ac5bd80","amp;dn":"Perelman-Figures_for_Fun-Stories_and_Conundrums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"112fabddb7378fb0cfff44ebc291c35a7ac5bd80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,47,171,221,183,55,143,176,207,255,68,235,194,145,195,90,122,197,189,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
