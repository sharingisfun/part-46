I did not scan any of these; simply repacked them for the convenience of new readers. Many thanks to the various scanners, including in particular the Minutemen group.\n\nThis is a great, great comic, as is everything Kirkman writes. Make sure you hang in there and read past issue 7 before passing judgment on it; it seems fairly generic (if fun) for those first 7 issues and then everything gets turned on its head.\n\nAs always, if you like it, BUY IT. Kirkman himself has said that he supports anything that results in an eventual sale, INCLUDING PIRACY. Which is why I have purchased the trades since downloading and reading, and so should you. This man is COMPLETELY FINE with you downloading his work if it leads to you actually starting to support him and his fantastic creative team. :) (And in his own words, he has kids to feed, man! KIDS!)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84b3d2309db7d12176385014ab6c72d8e5d3eec1","amp;dn":"Invincible+1-51","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84b3d2309db7d12176385014ab6c72d8e5d3eec1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,179,210,48,157,183,209,33,118,56,80,20,171,108,114,216,229,211,238,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
