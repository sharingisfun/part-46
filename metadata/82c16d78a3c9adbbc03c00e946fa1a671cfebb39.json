We also explore the lives of the truly famous, follow the great adventures of the past, taste the blood and thunder of battles, and look at how closely Hollywood blockbusters have told history. Plus, we answer questions about some of the more surprising and strange aspects of the past.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82c16d78a3c9adbbc03c00e946fa1a671cfebb39","amp;dn":"History+Revealed+Issue+5+-+July+2014++UK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82c16d78a3c9adbbc03c00e946fa1a671cfebb39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,193,109,120,163,201,173,187,192,60,0,233,70,250,26,103,28,254,187,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
