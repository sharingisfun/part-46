The focus is on the use of R, an open-source programming environment. Input and output, functions, data structures, and flow programming are covered, as are numerical techniques, probability, simulation, and stochastic modeling. Where appropriate, formal derivations are provided. The text is supplemented with simple yet relevant examples that allow students to see how the tools can be applied to contemporary problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b76e59a1cdd2b86f20d317139e5ac10e64ae417","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Scientific+Programming+and+Simulation+Using+R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b76e59a1cdd2b86f20d317139e5ac10e64ae417","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,118,229,154,28,221,43,134,242,13,49,113,57,229,172,16,230,74,228,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
