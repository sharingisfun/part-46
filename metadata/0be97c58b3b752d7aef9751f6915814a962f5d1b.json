In the process of preparing for the June 2007 show, Shadow and Cut recorded their rehearsals, allowing for this latest and greatest episode in all-45 mayhem: The Hard Sell. The first version of the CD, which featured a die-cut, DVD style cover, is now completely sold out.\n\nThis NEW version of the CD, recorded several months later, includes much of the material the duo had to scrap due to time constraints at the Bowl...and also a few routines deemed too complicated to attempt at the time! Now you can experience The Hard Sell the way it was originally intended, with the expanded Hard Sell (Encore) CD!\n\nAs with Freeze and Product Placement, the emphasis is on the eclectic; funk and hip-hop are present as is some rock. But Hard Sell is leaps and bounds beyond the expected, on a musical basis, as well as technical. Now utilizing 8 turntables and 2 loop pedals, new possibilities in live mixing are explored, as doo-wop mixes with punk, new wave with grime, and everything in between, all with taste and humor. Several classic hip-hop tracks are even ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsampledÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (via loop pedal) and reconstructed in real time, from their original elements.\n\nNow you can finally hear what all of the buzz has been about. Forget mash-ups, forget computers, and never mind the MP3sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦this is real turntablism at its genre-bending, skills-dominated best. The Hard Sell CD comes in a unique digipak design, with art by Paul Insect.\n\n===================================================================\n\nNo password, Very good quality [VBR up to 320Kbs], Ripped from original, All tagged, Included covers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0be97c58b3b752d7aef9751f6915814a962f5d1b","amp;dn":"DJ+Shadow+%26+Cut+Chemist+-+The+Hard+Sell+%28Encore%29+%28US+2008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0be97c58b3b752d7aef9751f6915814a962f5d1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,233,124,88,179,183,82,215,174,249,117,31,105,21,129,74,150,47,93,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
