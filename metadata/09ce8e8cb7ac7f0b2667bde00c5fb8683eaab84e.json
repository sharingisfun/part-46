Mostly shot from webcam, it is about a stoner called Rob, aka The Stoner Man. Rob does nothing but get wasted and does a wide range of things for your entertainment &amp; education while smoking weed/pot/bud/whatever you call it. Episodes that have been recorded so far include topics of weird things to make bongs out of, conservitive ways to smoke &amp; handy tips... but most of the episodes Ive seen are of Rob just being a dumbass stoned cunt for you to laugh at.\n\nI Highly recomend you get stoned first before watching this show videos, just makes them all the more funnier. I know the stoner man personally &amp; have permission to upload his videos here before they are released on youtube (apart from the first few episodes which are already out) so nothing illegal about this torrent except the fact its about drugs. lol\n\n\n\nThe Stoner Man Youtube Channel: Cant be displayed on TPB, See below\n\nI Also Have The Stoner Man's Personal Bebo Page: http://www.bebo.com/Profile.jsp?MemberId=4115879995 - Feel free to drop him a comment or ask for the shows youtube channel URL.\n\nThe Stoner Man Show Official Myspace: Shutdown\n\nThe Stoner Man Show Official Bebo: Shutdown\n\n\nFOR THE RECORD: \n                ROB IS A VETEREN STONER OFF CAMERA\n                ROB IS FROM AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND\n                ROB DOES NOT GROW NOR SELL, SO DONT ASK\n                ROB WILL USSUALLY SHARE MORE WEED THAN HE USES\n                ROB IS KEEN FOR A SESH WITH ANYBODY WHOS KEEN TO MEET HIM\n                ROB WANTS TO KNOW ALL OF YOU SO LEAVE A COMMENT OR GO HIS BEBO\n\n\n\n\nThis torrent includes the following episodes:\nThe Stoner Man\nS01E04 - Trip Down Memory Lane\nLength - 7:15\nSource: The Stoner Man Himself\nFirst Aired: 19/8/08\nFormat: WMV (Windows Media Video)\nLanguage: English\nSubs: English (Hes too stoned to understand)\nVideo Bitrate.: 308 kbps\nAudio Bitrate.: 357 kbps\nResolution..: 320x240\nYoutube Rating: N/A","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09ce8e8cb7ac7f0b2667bde00c5fb8683eaab84e","amp;dn":"The+Stoner+Man+S01E04+-+Trip+Down+Memory+Lane","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09ce8e8cb7ac7f0b2667bde00c5fb8683eaab84e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,206,142,140,183,172,127,11,38,103,189,224,12,95,184,104,62,170,184,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
