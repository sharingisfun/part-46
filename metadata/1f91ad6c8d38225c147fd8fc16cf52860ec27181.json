But it can also induce minor headaches at the most inopportune times, if you're not fully up to speed with its capabilities. In keeping with the spirit of the Annoyances series, the book adopts a sympathetic tone that will quickly win you over. Rather than blaming you for possessing limited Linux savvy, Linux Annoyances for Geeks takes you along for a fun-filled ride as you master the system together.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f91ad6c8d38225c147fd8fc16cf52860ec27181","amp;dn":"Linux+Annoyances+for+Geeks.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f91ad6c8d38225c147fd8fc16cf52860ec27181","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,145,173,108,141,56,34,92,20,127,216,252,22,207,82,134,14,194,113,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
