Cornwell).\nThis is the only studio album they released and is quite rare!\n\n\n\nWhether the result of, or the impetus for, the Stranglers' penchant for covering rock'n'roll standards (or just an indication of artistic burnout), J.J. Burnel and D. Greenfield launched a just-for-kicks sideband with Stranglers' saxman Alex Gifford (also piano with Van The Man &amp; half of the Propellerheads), ex-Vibrators guitarist John Ellis (he had opened for the Stranglers in the 1970s as a member of The Vibrators, filled in for H. Cornwell during his time in prison in 1980 and became the future Stranglers' guitarist during near ten years) and Manny Elias ( drummer for : Interview , Tears for Fears , P. Gabriel, etc...). \nOn two similarly titled but totally different albums, the Purple Helmets (nice name...) do nothing but relive the songs of their misspent youth. \nWhether they're playing &quot;Woolly Bully,&quot; &quot;I Can't Explain,&quot; &quot;Over Under Sideways Down&quot; and &quot;Not Fade Away&quot; on the live &quot;Ride Again&quot; or &quot;She's Not There,&quot; &quot;Money&quot; and &quot;First I Look at the Purse&quot; on &quot;Rise Again&quot;, a slightly more accomplished studio concoction. \nThe Purple Helmets approach their chosen jukebox classics with the enthusiasm of teenagers and the skill of seasoned professionals. \n                                                     \n                          TrouserPress (sonsofthedolls.blogspot.com)\n\n\n\n01.
