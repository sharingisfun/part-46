All too often, a first attempt at sound design involves a few tentative tweaks to an existing preset or blindly adjusting parameters until something sounds ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“rightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ often leading to a sound that lacks both character and definition. By contrast, the skill and experience of a good sound designer enables them to draw on a palette of key sounds and effects, each of which can be fine tuned to match the musical objective in mind.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32d262b96afa11be7382dc6f4d0226d238017c57","amp;dn":"MusicTech+Synthesis+Masterclass","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32d262b96afa11be7382dc6f4d0226d238017c57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,210,98,185,106,250,17,190,115,130,220,111,77,2,38,210,56,1,124,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
