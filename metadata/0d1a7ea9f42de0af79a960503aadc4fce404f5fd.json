Bandola and Vandeven, two Canadian-born friends who had moved to England in the late 1970s, shared song writing and lead vocal chores equally, although the bulk of the early (pre-album) material had been written by Vandeven.\n\nIn 1986, the band signed to indie label Big Time Records, who released their second album, Mania. The band&amp;#039;s songs were much more upbeat and bouncy this time around, and the sound was augmented by a thick wash of synthesizers, making the group sound very much like a typical trendy mid-80&amp;#039;s new wave group. The change in direction initially promised to be effective, as the album once again topped the all important CMJ charts, and MTV began playing their music video for the first single off the album, &quot;A Million Things&quot;. Both this song, and subsequent single &quot;New Message&quot;, were substantial college radio hits.\n\n\nThe Lucy Show - Mania [1986]\n\n01 Land and the Life \n02 View from the Outside \n03 Sojourn&amp;#039;s End \n04 Sad September \n05 Million Things \n06 Sun and Moon \n07 Shame \n08 Melody \n09 Part of Me Now \n10 New Message \n11 Million Things (original mix). \n12 Invitation\n13 Jam In E","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d1a7ea9f42de0af79a960503aadc4fce404f5fd","amp;dn":"The+Lucy+Show+-+Mania+%5B1986%5D+%5BRe-seed%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d1a7ea9f42de0af79a960503aadc4fce404f5fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,26,126,169,244,45,224,175,121,169,96,80,58,173,196,252,228,4,245,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
