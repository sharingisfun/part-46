Isaac Relyea from Brooklyn [audio presentation]\r\n\r\nFr. Isaac Relyea shares the amazing story of his motherâ€™s persistence in prayer for his conversion, Divine protection, supernatural grace, and the Lordâ€™s incredible mercy. He heard the call to the priesthood at an early age but was pulled away by the enticements of the world, had a change of heart, and became consumed with sinful pleasures. This story shows a striking similarity to the story of St. Augustine and his mother, St. Monica.\r\n\r\nLength: 53:19\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy this presentation, please seed and support Lighthouse Catholic Media, NFP, which is a 501(c)(3) Not For Profit Company that seeks to answer the call for a New Evangelization.
