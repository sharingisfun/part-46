The air war effectively ended at 10.58am on August 9th 1945, when a solitary B-29 Superfortress over the Japanese city of Nagasaki dropped the second atomic bomb. The Stukas carried 250kg bombs: the a-bomb dropped by the B-29 was equivalent to 23,000 tons of TNT. In just six years of warfare, air power had changed and grown in destruction capability almost beyond recognition.\nBased on the international bestselling book by Walter Boyne, CLASH OF WINGS is the definitive film history of aerial warfare during World War Two.
