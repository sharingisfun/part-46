It reports to the \ntracker that it&amp;#039;s uploading (or downloading or both, it&amp;#039;s your choice) at a certain \nrate, thus making it useful for artificially increasing your ratio on certain sites \nthat track a user&amp;#039;s overall ratio (total uploaded/total downloaded).\nRatioMaster has hardcoded emulations for the most commonly used BitTorrent clients, \nbut it is also able to parse external files for emulation settings, thus making it easily\nextensible for your favorite client and easy to update when new versions of said clients\nare released. The client files (extension &quot;.client&quot;) are actually renamed XML files and \nthe syntax should be pretty straight-forward. The emulation layer includes support for \nparameter order in GETs, reproduction of HTTP headers, generation of application-specific\npeer_ids and keys and more. RatioMaster can also parse the tracker reannounce time from \nthe tracker&amp;#039;s HTTP response, and combined with the fact that you can specify down and \nup rates makes it pretty hard to detect by any anti-cheat scripts, if not downright \nimpossible. Other features, like a TCP listener (so as to appear connectable on the \ntracker&amp;#039;s peerlist) and a leecher counter (so as to stop any uploads when a torrent \nhas 0 leechers) also contribute to RatioMaster&amp;#039;s spoofing abilities.\n\nMemory Reader\n--------------------\nStarting from version 1.6 RatioMaster have integrated Memory Reader tool that usefull \nwhen you want to read exact Peer ID, Key, Port and Number of peers announce parameters\nfrom your regular torrent client (like uTorrent,Azureus,Bitcomet or others). Look for\nthe &amp;#039;Memory Reader&amp;#039; button in Advanced Tab.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4234775645c7fc06b80c24c599e0e17607c70b39","amp;dn":"Ratio+Master+1.7.5.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4234775645c7fc06b80c24c599e0e17607c70b39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,52,119,86,69,199,252,6,184,12,36,197,153,224,225,118,7,199,11,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
