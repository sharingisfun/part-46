Everyone is damaged here; it's insightful, but don't expect a barrel of laughs. You do get to see two great actresses together.\n\nI went to a lot of trouble to get the subtitles in shape for this one, I hope my effort is appreciated. People should pay a lot more attention to Lanctot than they do.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b1deeee50e19ceb99a7ac27088218cd236869df","amp;dn":"Suzie+%282009%29+Micheline+Lanctot+Pascale+Bussieres","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b1deeee50e19ceb99a7ac27088218cd236869df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,29,238,238,80,225,156,235,153,167,172,39,8,130,24,205,35,104,105,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
