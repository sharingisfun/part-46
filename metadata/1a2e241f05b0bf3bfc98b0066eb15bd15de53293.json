The group consisted of a large number of singers of diverse ethnic origin, some of whom such as John Lawton also performed with other groups. \n\nAnother member was JÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼rgen Drews; who later started a long-running solo career, starting with his 1976 hit  in Germany, &quot;Ein Bett im Kornfeld&quot;, a cover version of \n&quot;Let Your Love Flow&quot; by the Bellamy Brothers.\n\nAdditional members included Liz Mitchell, later front woman with Boney M., and John Lawton, who also sang for the German progressive/hard rock band Lucifer's Friend and would go on to be the frontman for Uriah Heep. The Les Humphries Singers dissolved at the end of the 1970s, after Humphries had left due to tax liabilities to his English homeland, Alton Hampshire.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a2e241f05b0bf3bfc98b0066eb15bd15de53293","amp;dn":"Les+Humphries+Singers+-+Mama+Loo+%28German+Disco+Show+1973%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a2e241f05b0bf3bfc98b0066eb15bd15de53293","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,46,36,31,5,176,191,59,252,152,176,6,110,177,91,209,93,229,50,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
