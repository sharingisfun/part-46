Pixel here.\nEpisodes contained in this compilation are from diffrent sources:\nMost of them are from\nSome of them (First 30 and Open Book) I got from the torrent made by BloodSand on ThePirateBay.\nAlmost all of the episodes are Logoless in HD (Except Open Book, that is with a CN logo).\nOrder of the episodes (In Season one at least) is based on Ian Jones Quartey's &quot;Intended Order&quot;.\nThis means that episodes are cannonicly chonological. So some of the episodes in S2 were moved to S1 for the continuity sake.\nEpisodes through 1 to 10 are in pairs (1&amp;2, 3&amp;4, 5&amp;6, 7&amp;8 and 9&amp;10).\nAs this compilation was made, the last episode I was able to add is Nightmare Hospital.\n\nI'll make more torrents with episodes in future, 10 episodes per torrent.\n\nWhat more can I say? Get some popcorn and enjoy the ride!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3505df38c95aac8a33ccaf4dc6863dbadbd5155","amp;dn":"Steven+Universe+1+-+68+Logoless+HD+%5BREUPLOAD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3505df38c95aac8a33ccaf4dc6863dbadbd5155","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,80,93,243,140,149,170,200,163,60,202,244,220,104,99,219,173,189,81,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
