Winding spare but lovely folk-tinged melodies around indie rock guitar figures and ethereal vocals, the Sandwitches do a masterful job of creating more out of less; these performances are built around minimal frameworks, but Grace Cooper and Heidi AlexanderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocals conjure an impressive range of world-weary emotions with their rough but quietly passionate delivery, and the low-key arrangements are the perfect match for the voices, giving them just the right support without taking up more space than necessary. And while most of these songs feel comfortably sad, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a sweetness and lack of guile in the delivery that somehow makes Our Toast sound optimistic in spite of it all, especially on the girl group-influenced Ã¢â‚¬Å“MiggyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the opener Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sunny Side,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which plays like a hipster update of the Carter Family. There are moments when Our Toast is so subdued it threatens to curl up and fall asleep (especially on the slightly shambling Ã¢â‚¬Å“Island JamÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), but despite the tempos being slow and the technique casual, the emotions behind this music are strong and easy to follow, and when Cooper and Alexander join their voices with drummer Roxy Brodeur, the effect is bigger than one might expect and fully capable of tugging on the heartstrings. The spontaneous texture of the Sandwitches may feel a bit rough, but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plenty of beauty here if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re willing to dig beneath the surface, and Our Toast shows that indie rock without overwhelming irony has finally become a reality, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s good to have around. \nRating 9/10 \n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist: \n01 Sunny Side.flac \n02 Play It Again Dick.flac \n03 Sleeping Practice.flac \n04 Dead Prudence.flac \n05 Miggy.flac \n06 Island Jam.flac \n07 Personal Hell.flac \n08 Wickerman Mambo.flac \n09 Nothing But Love.flac \n\n\nSummary: \nCountry: USA \nGenre: Indie-Folk \n\n\nMedia Report: \nSource : CD \nFormat : FLAC \nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM \nBit rate mode : Variable \nBit rate : ~614-795 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz \nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad4ee9159e30e5d5dd2c0dd504cee9f5e2c4dbf2","amp;dn":"%282015%29+The+Sandwitches+-+Our+Toast+%5BFLAC%2CTracks%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad4ee9159e30e5d5dd2c0dd504cee9f5e2c4dbf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,78,233,21,158,48,229,213,221,44,13,213,4,206,233,245,226,196,219,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
