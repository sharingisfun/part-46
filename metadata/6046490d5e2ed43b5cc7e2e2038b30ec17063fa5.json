He finds the welcome from the hotel's only &quot;guests&quot; chilly except for Gaye Dawn (a funny and perhaps prescient Hollywood stage name) played by Claire Trevor who is drunk and befriends him. After a bit McCloud discovers that the hotel's owner Nora Temple (Lauren Bacall) and her invalid father-in-law James Temple (Lionel Barrymore) have been tricked into allowing Rocco's gang to stay and now, as a tropical storm begins to blow, are being held at gunpoint. McCloud's delicate task is to keep the megalomaniac and murderous personality of Rocco under some control so that he doesn't murder everyone.\r\n\r\nRip Specs (BD Rip)\r\n\r\nGeneral           : Key Largo.1948.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea.mkv\r\nFormat            : Matroska at 6 617 Kbps\r\nLength            : 4.64 GiB for 1h 40mn 24s 440ms\r\n\r\nVideo #0          : AVC at 5 960 Kbps\r\nAspect            : 986 x 720 (1.369) at 23.976 fps\r\n\r\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 640 Kbps\r\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\r\nLanguage          : en\r\n\r\nText #0           : VobSub\r\nLanguage          : en\r\n\r\nText #1           : VobSub\r\nLanguage          : fr\r\n\r\nText #2           : VobSub\r\nLanguage          : de\r\n\r\nText #3           : VobSub\r\nLanguage          : es\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040506/\r\n\r\nAudio Language: English\r\nSubtitles: English HOH, french, German, Spanish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6046490d5e2ed43b5cc7e2e2038b30ec17063fa5","amp;dn":"Key+Largo.1948.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6046490d5e2ed43b5cc7e2e2038b30ec17063fa5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,70,73,13,94,46,212,59,92,199,226,226,3,139,48,236,23,6,63,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
