Ridley and Francine decide to leave the group, while Jason heads to the dormitory of his girlfriend Debra Monahan. She does not succeed in contacting her family and they travel in Mary's van to the house of Debra's parents in Scranton, Pennsylvania. While driving her van, Mary sees a car accident and runs over a highway patrolman and three other zombies trying to escape from them. Later the religious Mary is depressed, questioning whether the victims where really dead, and tries to commit suicide, shooting herself with a pistol. Her friends take her to a hospital where they realize that the dead are indeed awaking and walking and they need to fight to survive while traveling to Debra's parents house.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848557/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848557/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6181c5292b7cf798ecb8ac101c8b5b3bc09bf78c","amp;dn":"Diary+Of+the+Dead+%282007%29%28IPOD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6181c5292b7cf798ecb8ac101c8b5b3bc09bf78c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,129,197,41,43,124,247,152,236,184,172,16,28,139,91,59,192,155,247,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
