Arthur discovers that the key to success lies in his own descent into the land of the Minimoys, creatures no larger than a tooth, whom his grandfather helped relocate to their garden. Somewhere among them is hidden a pile of rubies, too. Can Arthur be of stout heart and save the day? Romance beckons as well, and a villain lurks.\n\nMore movie info: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0344854/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0344854/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGenre....: Adventure | Family | Fantasy\nActors:..: Freddie Highmore, Mia Farrow\nSource...: Bluray 720p\nContainer: Mp4\nVideo....: AVC x264 1280x544 2222kbps 23.976fs\nAudio....: English AC3 48KHz 6ch 384Kbps\nRuntime..: 01:43\nFilesize.: 1.86GB\nSubtitle.: English (.srt files)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Arthur 2 and the Revenge of Maltazard 2009\n\nStoryline:\nArthur answers a distress call from Princess Selenia, who is menaced by the nefarious Maltazard.\n\nMore movie info: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0940657/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0940657/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGenre....: Adventure | Family | Fantasy\nActors:..: Freddie Highmore, Mia Farrow\nSource...: Bluray 720p\nContainer: Mp4\nVideo....: AVC x264 1280x544 2222kbps 23.976fs\nAudio....: English AC3 48KHz 6ch 384Kbps\nRuntime..: 01:33\nFilesize.: 1.71GB\nSubtitle.: English (.srt files)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Arthur 3 The War of the Two Worlds 2010\n\nStoryline:\nMaltazard, the Evil M, is now 7 feet tall and evolving among the humans, causing terror wherever he goes. His goal is simple: forming an army of giant henchmen and ruling over the universe. Meanwhile, Arthur is still a Minimoy, and thus in a state where he's unable to fend him off. With the help of Selenia and Betameche, he hatches a plan to regain his usual size: all they must do is infiltrate Arthur's house through the pipeworks, catch an electric train from his bedroom to his grandfather's study and find an elixir that will make him grow back to his human size. Sounds simple enough, if it weren't for Darkos, Maltazard's own son, hot on their tails. \n\nMore movie info: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0940656/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0940656/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGenre....: Adventure | Family | Fantasy\nActors:..: Freddie Highmore, Mia Farrow\nSource...: Bluray 720p\nContainer: Mp4\nVideo....: AVC x264 1280x544 2222kbps 23.976fs\nAudio....: English AC3 48KHz 6ch 384Kbps\nRuntime..: 01:41\nFilesize.: 1.84GB\nSubtitle.: English (.srt files)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore subtitles: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://subscene.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://subscene.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sub-titles.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sub-titles.net&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMovie snapshot is included in torrent.\n\nMy Torrents: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/PetaFOX&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/PetaFOX&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f42bb938cdf6d80ddf72dd294449e1c72c2d22b","amp;dn":"Arthur+Trilogy+1+2+3+Bluray+2006+2009+2010+720p+x264+ac3+jbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f42bb938cdf6d80ddf72dd294449e1c72c2d22b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,66,187,147,140,223,109,128,221,247,45,210,148,68,158,28,114,194,210,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
