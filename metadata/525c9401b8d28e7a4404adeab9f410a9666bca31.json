CIA officer Claire Stenwick and Ray Koval are both racing to secure the formula for a product that will bring untold wealth to the company that lands the patent first as the stakes begin to rise, and their passions start to flare. Meanwhile, their mutual employers, industry giant Howerd Tully and trailblazing CEO Dick Garsil start resorting to some seriously underhanded tactics in hope of gaining an advantage over the competition. Loners by definition of their own careers, Claire and Ray engage in a series of schemes and double-crosses while contending with the fact that their mutual attraction could ultimately jeopardize their entire missions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:525c9401b8d28e7a4404adeab9f410a9666bca31","amp;dn":"Duplicity+Trailer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"525c9401b8d28e7a4404adeab9f410a9666bca31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,92,148,1,184,210,142,122,68,4,173,234,185,244,16,169,102,107,202,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
