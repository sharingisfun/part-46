But beyond the fringes of explored space lurk the Reapers, a race of \nsentient starships bent on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œharvestingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the galaxyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s organic species for their \nown dark purpose.\n\nThe Illusive Man, leader of the pro-human black ops group Cerberus, is one of \nthe few who know the truth about the Reapers.

Together they set out to \nfind the secret Cerberus facility where Grayson is being held. But they arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t \nthe only ones after him. And time is running out.\n\nAs the experiments continue, the sinister Reaper technology twists GraysonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \nmind. The insidious whispers grow ever stronger in his head, threatening to take \nover his very identity and unleash the Reapers on an unsuspecting galaxy.\n\nThis novel is based on a Mature-rated video game.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Release Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThere is some places where the audio tones out and in. And some places where \nthere's maybe a little chop in the sound. Nothing major. It's just in some \nplaces. The source was like that. So I can't do anything about it.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nYeah, and the audiobook is split into chapters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&quot;I love girls, I love women, I love babes.
