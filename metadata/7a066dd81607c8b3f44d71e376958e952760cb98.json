She takes her assumed name, Somerset Holmes, from a sign advertising a housing project, Somerset Homes.\n\nThe physical appearance of the main character was based on author Jones' wife April Campbell, a former model, who posed as photo reference for the character, including the image used for the first issue's cover.\n\nThe series was a conscious attempt to create a comics property that could then be sold to Hollywood as a movie, and the storyline, panel arrangements and scene angles were consciously cinematic. Somerset Holmes, although never made into a movie, was actually optioned by Ed Pressman and, because of the screenplay Jones and Campbell wrote for it, both gained Hollywood agents and were accepted into the Screen Writers Guild. They subsequently worked on television and movie projects, as well as more comic books, and both went on to write novels.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a066dd81607c8b3f44d71e376958e952760cb98","amp;dn":"Somerset+Holmes+%28Restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a066dd81607c8b3f44d71e376958e952760cb98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,6,109,216,22,7,200,179,244,77,113,227,118,149,142,149,39,96,203,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
