The book will also provide C# and C++/CX code samples as online companion content. The Sixth Edition is planned as about 20 chapters organized in three parts:\n\n    Part I, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Elementals,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ begins with the interrelationship between code and XAML, basic event handling, dynamic layout, controls, the application bar, control customization, and collections. You should emerge from Part I ready to create sophisticated page-oriented collection-based user interfaces using the powerful ListView and GridView controls.\n    Part II, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Infrastructure,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ examines the level underneath the UI. In these chapters, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll go deeper into Windows 8 with a complete exploration of the multitouch interface, asynchronous operations for working with files and web services, networking, security, and globalization. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll see particular emphasis on data sharing, and interfacing with the search panes and contract panes of Windows 8.\n    Part III, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Specialties,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ explores topics you might not need for every program but are essential to a well-rounded education in Windows 8. It includes working with the sensors (GPS and orientation), vector graphics, bitmap graphics, media, text, printing, and obtaining input from the stylus and handwriting recognizer.\n\n\n\nTo celebrate, Microsoft Press will release three versions of the eBook for Programming Windows, Sixth Edition, including two pre-release editions that provide crucial access to early content. Based on when you purchase (see table below), you will receive the most recently published version of the eBookÃ¢â‚¬â€plus any subsequent versions\n\n\n294 Pages\n\nMay 2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23d24be59b673e9b75d26dc0f22d426e22bde726","amp;dn":"Programming+Windows+%2C6th+Ed.+%28consumer+preview%29%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23d24be59b673e9b75d26dc0f22d426e22bde726","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,210,75,229,155,103,62,155,117,210,109,192,242,45,66,110,34,189,231,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
