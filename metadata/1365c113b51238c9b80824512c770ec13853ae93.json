These\nexperiences are then juxtaposed with moments of intense\nbeauty and excitement,such as the connection that can be\nfelt with an audience.With touring comes extensive\nworldwide travel,and Moby has fallen prey to insomnia most\nof his adult life,a condition he turns to his\nadvantage.All of the songs on DESTROYED were written by\nMoby on the road during the small hours of the night,when\nhis insomnia was in full tilt.The silent urban nightscapes\nprovided much inspiration for this album. To illustrate\nthe music on DESTROYED,a book of the same name with 55 of\nMoby's photographs will be released simultaneously.These\nshots were taken around the world while he was on\ntour,illustrating the sense of contrasting emotions Moby\nfeels during that time.\n\nSupport the artists and buy their music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1365c113b51238c9b80824512c770ec13853ae93","amp;dn":"Moby-Destroyed-2011-CaHeSo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1365c113b51238c9b80824512c770ec13853ae93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,101,193,19,181,18,56,201,184,8,36,81,44,119,14,193,56,83,174,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
