His uncle runs a market in the Bronx and Keong offers to help out while Uncle is on his honeymoon. During his stay in the Bronx, Keong befriends a neighbor kid and beats up some neighborhood thugs who cause problems at the market. Meanwhile, one of those petty thugs in the local gang stumbles into a criminal situation way over his head. Blinded by greed, his involvement draws his gang, the kid, Keong, and the whole neighborhood into a deadly crossfire. When the lazy cops fail to successfully resolve matters, Keong takes things into his own hands. Needless to say, much spectacular kung-fu and outrageous action sequences follow.\n\nThunderBytes Presents.......: Rumble In The Bronx....1717alan..avi\n\n_______________________File Information_______________________\nFile Size.......: 734,011,392Bytes\nDuration.......: 1:25:09\nBytes Missing.......: 0\nIMDB Link.......:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113326/ \nRating.......:User Rating: 6.5/10\n\n______________________Video Information______________________\nVideo Codec.......: XviD 1.1.2 Final - AVI(.AVI) - OpenDML (AVI v2.0), \nResolution.......: 608x272\nVideo Bitrate.......: 1019 kb/s\nFPS.......: 25.000\nDisplay Aspect Ratio.......: 2.235\nBits / Pixel.......: 0.246\n\n______________________Audio Information______________________\nAudio Streams.......: 1\nAudio Codec.......: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate.......: 117kb/s - VBR - 48000 Hz\nAudio Channel Count.......: 2\nAudio alignment.......: Aligned\nInterleave.......: 40ms\nPreload.......: 504ms\n\nOriginal Source.......PAL-16:9\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fae7bfdaf6b5649d945454ee62f8dab94caf0a5a","amp;dn":"Rumble+In+The+Bronx....%5BJackie.Chan%5D....xvid.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fae7bfdaf6b5649d945454ee62f8dab94caf0a5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,231,191,218,246,181,100,157,148,84,84,238,98,248,218,185,76,175,10,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
