(Viagra)&quot; is the first single released from producer-rapper 88-Keys' debut album The Death of Adam and features the album's co-executive producer Kanye West. The song samples &quot;All Night Loving&quot; by British R&amp;B three-piece band Imagination. The single was released digitally on August 25, 2008. According to both artists, the song, which follows the overall storyline of the concept album, is about a man named Adam, who after a bad string of relationships, decides to take Viagra in an attempt &quot;stay up&quot; longer. A snippet of the track was first previewed on Kanye West's 2007 Can't Tell Me Nothing mixtape and featured an additional spoken word verse delivered by Malik Yusef.\n\nThe music video premiered across multiple MTV channels all day on Monday, March 16, 2009.\n\nThe video features 88-Keys (Rufus) and Kanye West (Clifford) dressed in full prosthetic makeup made to appear in their late sixties, out on a night on the town. Utilizing the talents of makeup artist Tony Gardner of Alterian Effects (Michael JacksonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s &quot;Thriller&quot;, &quot;Hairspray&quot;, &quot;Shallow Hal&quot;, &quot;Seed of Chucky&quot;, Daft Punk) the video creates an intimate and comedic look at the two real life friends.\n\nAccording to director Jason Goldwatch,\n \t&quot;The ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Stay Up!' (Viagra) video represents a new wave in the Music Video. It is a smash up of music video, reality television, and highbrow conceptual art. By taking some of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s biggest stars, who are normally surrounded by security and droves of crazed fans, and hiding their identity, we allow them to interact with the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“real worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, unrecognized, unhindered, and free to walk alone ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ almost as if new people.&quot;\n\nThe Death of Adam is the debut album by producer and rapper 88-Keys. Released on November 11, 2008, the album features guest appearances by Kanye West, Kid Cudi, J Davey, Redman, Bilal, Phonte of Little Brother, and alternative rock group Shitake Monkey.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2b7a7d244cabf1d6366c5fe819e931dea7883b9","amp;dn":"88+Keys+feat.+Kanye+West+-+Stay+Up+%28Viagra%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2b7a7d244cabf1d6366c5fe819e931dea7883b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,183,167,210,68,202,191,29,99,102,197,254,129,158,147,29,234,120,131,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
