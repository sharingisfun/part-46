Amazingly, he completed the task in an intense six weeks, and &quot;Eine kurze Weltgeschichte fur junge Leser&quot; was published in Vienna to immediate success, and is now available in twenty-five languages across the world. In forty concise chapters, Gombrich tells the story of man from the stone age to the atomic bomb. In between emerges a colourful picture of wars and conquests, grand works of art, and the spread and limitations of science. This is a text dominated not by dates and facts, but by the sweep of mankind's experience across the centuries, a guide to humanity's achievements and an acute witness to its frailties.The product of a generous and humane sensibility, this timeless account makes intelligible the full span of human history.\n\n(Amazon.com)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3ccd6c8a7819b2970313d7bf813dc0d15786539","amp;dn":"A+Little+History+of+the+World+-+E.H.+Gombrich","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3ccd6c8a7819b2970313d7bf813dc0d15786539","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,204,214,200,167,129,155,41,112,49,61,123,248,19,220,13,21,120,101,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
