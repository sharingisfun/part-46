Goyer\nStarring: Odette Yustman, Gary Oldman, Meagan Good, Idris Elba\n\nA young woman fights the spirit that is slowly taking possession of her.\n\nNOTES:\nThis is a re-encode of camera's cam.......\nThe audio on this is pretty good specially for cam :)\nHowever the video as a few faults,the main being the RGB colours were well over.....too much red and\nblue and not enough green.\nThere's also some heads at the bottom aswell,and i know there is at least one scene when someone walks past the \ncamera.\nAfter saying all that the basics are there for a decent cam.....just needs a few tweaks\n\nWORK DONE:\nRight the first thing was to sort out the RGB colours...... i needed to reduce the red and blue and add more green.\nOnce done i needed to then add alot more contrast and also reduce the chroma down alot as there was way too much \ncolour.......After sorting that out i needed to correct the brightness and reduce the bright spots.\nAs for the heads in the bottom and the bloke walking past they all remain in the film.......the heads could be cropped but by \nthe looks it's already had loads cropped of it as it was and anymore would ruin the film.\n\nScreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/unborn/snapshot20090114202152.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/unborn/snapshot20090114202152.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/unborn/vlcsnap-17180.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/unborn/vlcsnap-17180.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/unborn/vlcsnap-18889.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/unborn/vlcsnap-18889.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/unborn/vlcsnap-19058.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/unborn/vlcsnap-19058.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBEFORE: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/unborn/vlcsnap-25662.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/unborn/vlcsnap-25662.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAFTER: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/unborn/vlcsnap-25879.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/unborn/vlcsnap-25879.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e09028a4ebe2bb0d6b761f61282ee743e0145bb6","amp;dn":"The+Unborn+CAM+XVID+-+STG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e09028a4ebe2bb0d6b761f61282ee743e0145bb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,144,40,164,235,226,187,13,107,118,31,97,40,46,231,67,224,20,91,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
