Disciple uses their triumphs and failures to craft songs that challenge, confront and comfort us in our faith. Includes the future hit songs, \\'Come Home\\', \\'Southern Hospitality\\' and \\'Across The Fire.\\' Produced by Travis Wyrick (P.O.D, Pillar, tobyMac, Superchick). In their 14 years together, Knoxville, Tennessee band Disciple have matured from an aggressive Metal band to a quartet with a strong sense of melody and penchant for the unexpected.
