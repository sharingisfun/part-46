Almost 95 percent of the shoreline today belong to the European Union, but the differences from country to country are enormous. The cinematic journey around the Baltic sea tells the stories of people - on lonely islands, secluded in the border areas into vibrant cities.

With the ferry from Helsinki across to Tallinn, Riga, on the Curonian Spit and finally to the Polish coast. The last stop of the trip is Szczecin.
