Leveraging valuable classroom insight gained by the authors during their impressive and ongoing teaching careers, this text emphasizes concepts rather than numerical methods, providing presentation/project problems at the end of each chapter to enhance subject knowledge.\r\n\r\nHighlighting the essence of electromagnetic field (EMF) theory and its correlation with electrical machines, this book:\r\n\r\n- Reviews Maxwellâ€™s equations and scalar and vector potentials\r\n- Describes the special cases leading to the Laplace, Poissonâ€™s, eddy current, and wave equations\r\n- Explores the utility of the uniqueness, generalized Poynting, Helmholtz, and approximation theorems\r\n- Discusses the Schwarzâ€“Christoffel transformation, as well as the determination of airgap permeance\r\n- Addresses the skin effects in circular conductors and eddy currents in solid and laminated iron cores\r\n- Contains examples relating to the slot leakage inductance of rotating electrical machines, transformer leakage inductance, and theory of hysteresis machines\r\n- Presents analyses of EMFs in laminated-rotor induction machines, three-dimensional field analyses for three-phase solid rotor induction machines, and more\r\n\r\nElectromagnetics for Electrical Machines makes an ideal text for postgraduate-level students of electrical engineering, as well as of physics and electronics and communication engineering. It is also a useful reference for research scholars concerned with problems involving electromagnetics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1612d1627e4b07eee323969c12af9aa7c7c8b8ff","amp;dn":"Electromagnetics+For+Electrical+Machines+%5B2015%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1612d1627e4b07eee323969c12af9aa7c7c8b8ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,18,209,98,126,75,7,238,227,35,150,156,18,175,154,167,199,200,184,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
