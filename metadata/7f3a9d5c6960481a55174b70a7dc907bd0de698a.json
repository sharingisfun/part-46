Released during an especially productive period for the loosely termed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œambient music,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ LIFEFORMS had considerable impact upon the musical picture of 1994. Few (if any) outfits could claim to have bettered FSOLÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s epic offering that year.\n\nLIFEFORMS equally rewards both intensive and passive listening. Intensive listening reveals a taut structure, with long periods of timelessness suddenly pushed onward by contemporary dub and house beats. Passive listening gives a 90-minute collage of sound that provides a chilled-out antidote to the pace of modern life. Running water, distant chants, tribal rhythms, and various Eno-esque noises are all presented here in glorious surround-sound. Listening on headphones reveals the beauty of the soundscape even more brilliantly. FSOL must have spent many a late night learning how to employ sound technology so well. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s time well spent, though, as LIFEFORMS is a masterpiece that stands comparison with great ambient albums by the Orb, Brian Eno, and the KLF. Recommended without reservation.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f3a9d5c6960481a55174b70a7dc907bd0de698a","amp;dn":"FSOL+-+Lifeforms+%282-Disc%29+%281994%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f3a9d5c6960481a55174b70a7dc907bd0de698a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,58,157,92,105,96,72,26,85,23,75,112,167,220,144,123,208,222,105,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
