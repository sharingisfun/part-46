Myths are proved true, probable, possible, improbable or busted. Often after the real-world practical tests have proved or debunked a Myth, the team will take the experiment to the extreme, many times using more modern technology than the myth could have used or upping the black powder for impressive explosions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d80cbea5055ee3e83edaafea97f4596a81869c85","amp;dn":"MythBusters.S12E08.HDTV.x264-KILLERS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d80cbea5055ee3e83edaafea97f4596a81869c85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,12,190,165,5,94,227,232,62,218,175,234,151,244,89,106,129,134,156,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
