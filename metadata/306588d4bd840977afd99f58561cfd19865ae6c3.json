Things are amiss at 99 Maple Lane: Ingrid's dad's job is in jeopardy, but he won't explain why.

True to her hero, Sherlock Holmes, Ingrid begins fishing around to find out who's really pulling the strings in Echo Falls. But one morning, while en route to the dreaded MathFest, Ingrid is kidnapped and locked in the trunk of a car.
