In fact, quite the opposite, things are cranking up now that the British team is facing potentially huge difficulties after earlier, unexpected events. And team leader Bruce Parry has to make tough decisions that will inevitably cause crushing disappointment to some of his colleagues. The journey concludes with two episodes next week.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82a9dd1743a479090264778056d295a7f66bc93d","amp;dn":"Blizzard_Race_to_the_Pole_1x4.AVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82a9dd1743a479090264778056d295a7f66bc93d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,169,221,23,67,164,121,9,2,100,119,128,86,210,149,167,246,107,201,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
