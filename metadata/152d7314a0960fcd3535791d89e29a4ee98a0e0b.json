The frontier reviews provide the current state of knowledge in these fields and are written by experts who are internationally known for their eminent research contributions. The journal is essential reading to all synthetic organic chemists. Current Organic Synthesis should prove to be of great interest to synthetic chemists in academia and industry who wish to keep abreast with recent developments in key fields of organic synthesis","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:152d7314a0960fcd3535791d89e29a4ee98a0e0b","amp;dn":"Current+Organic+Synthesis+%282004-2013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"152d7314a0960fcd3535791d89e29a4ee98a0e0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,45,115,20,160,150,15,205,53,53,121,29,137,226,154,78,233,138,14,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
