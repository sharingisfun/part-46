The exposition is example- and problem-oriented, where the applications are taken from mathematics, numerical calculus, statistics, physics, biology, and finance. The book teaches &quot;Matlab-style&quot; and procedural programming as well as object-oriented programming. High school mathematics is a required background, and it is advantageous to study classical and numerical one-variable calculus in parallel with reading this book. Besides learning how to program computers, the reader will also learn how to solve mathematical problems, arising in various branches of science and engineering, with the aid of numerical methods and programming. By blending programming, mathematics and scientific applications, the book lays a solid foundation for practicing computational science.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 736 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 2nd Edition. edition (June 28, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 3642183654\n    * ISBN-13: 978-3642183652","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:525eeda54bc7adcd7a013d9a2fd4c409d782c1af","amp;dn":"A+Primer+on+Scientific+Programming+With+Python+2nd+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"525eeda54bc7adcd7a013d9a2fd4c409d782c1af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,94,237,165,75,199,173,205,122,1,61,154,47,212,196,9,215,130,193,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
