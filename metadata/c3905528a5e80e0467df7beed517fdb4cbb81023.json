It uses great acting and loads of exciting special effects and sci-fi aliens that totally rock. The show started originally back in 1963, when William Hartnell stepped in as a pequiliar fellow named the doctor, who lived with his neice in a police box. His niece's teachers wanted to meet him, so they broke in to the police box, only to find out that this box was a time machine, and they were suddenly whisked away on a series of strange but wonderful adventures to numerous other worlds.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3905528a5e80e0467df7beed517fdb4cbb81023","amp;dn":"Doctor.Who.2005.S07E13.The.Name.Of.The.Doctor.HDTV.x264-FoV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3905528a5e80e0467df7beed517fdb4cbb81023","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,144,85,40,165,232,14,4,103,223,123,238,213,23,253,180,203,184,16,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
