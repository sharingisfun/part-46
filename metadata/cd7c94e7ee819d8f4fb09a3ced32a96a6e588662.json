Climate change seems inevitable with countless hurricanes, earthquakes and innumerable disasters around the globe in recent years. What did the ancient Maya know and why did they place such significance on this date? As we near the final date of the Mayan Calendar, mankind must face what is perhaps the most difficult hurdle of alla profound change in ourselves. This enigmatic film unveils the other side to the 2012 engima;\n\n\nGeoff Stray and Philip Coppens take us on a journey into the Mayan mysteries to uncover a startling perspective on 2012, the lost meaning of the great cycle of the ages. They challenge the doomsday prophets and argue that 2012 is not the apocalyptic end of times, it is in fact only the beginning. Time will never be the same again.\n\n\n\n\nDirected by: Philip Gardiner\n============================\n\n\nWritten by: Geoff Stray &amp; Philip Coppens\n========================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    2012 Mayan Prophecy And The Shift Of The Ages\nYear.................:    2009\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    01:29:59\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3)\nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    640x352\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    1688 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (N/A) \nFile Size:...........:    1.06 GB\nFPS..................:    29.970000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2009\n\n\n\n\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1961145/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1961145/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\\\\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\\\\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\\\\\&quot;nfo\\\\\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            *** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd7c94e7ee819d8f4fb09a3ced32a96a6e588662","amp;dn":"2012+Mayan+Prophecy+And+The+Shift+Of+The+Ages-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd7c94e7ee819d8f4fb09a3ced32a96a6e588662","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,124,148,231,238,129,157,143,79,176,154,60,237,50,169,106,110,88,134,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
