From George Washington to George W. Bush, THE PRESIDENTS gathers together vivid snapshots of all 43 Commanders in Chief who have guided America throughout its history--their powerful personalities, weaknesses, and major achievements or historical insignificance. Based on the book To the Best of My Ability, edited by Pulitzer Prize-winner James McPherson, THE PRESIDENTS features rare and unseen photographs and footage, unexpected insight and trivia from journalists, scholars, and politicians such as Walter Cronkite, David Brinkley, Wesley Clark, Bob Dole, and former President Jimmy Carter. Viewed within the changing contexts of each administration, the Presidency has never seemed more compelling and human. Narrated by Edward Herrmann (The Aviator), this three-DVD set is a proud addition to the award-winning documentary tradition of THE HISTORY CHANNEL.\n\n\n\nNote: This does include that douche bag George Bush jr.\n\n\n\n\nUSA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5950736f414fcf35c767ed4d7946f91826c37b1","amp;dn":"The+History+Channel+Presents+The+Presidents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5950736f414fcf35c767ed4d7946f91826c37b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,149,7,54,244,20,252,243,92,118,126,212,215,148,111,145,130,108,55,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
