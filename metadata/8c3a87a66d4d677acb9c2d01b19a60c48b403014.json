Hall since 1986. Currently called King Missile III (pronounced &quot;the third&quot;), the group released its ninth and most recent studio album, Royal Lunch, in 2004.\n\nThe band recorded its second major-label album, Happy Hour, released on December 15, 1992. The album debuted at #1 on the CMJ charts, and its accompanying first single, &quot;Detachable Penis,&quot; became a modest hit, reaching #25 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. Atlantic released videos for &quot;Detachable Penis&quot; and the subsequent singles &quot;(Why Are We) Trapped?&quot; and &quot;Martin Scorsese,&quot; but neither follow-up single achieved the chart success of &quot;Detachable.&quot;\n\nIn the music video a guy goes to a party, loses his detachable penis and must search for it to see if it pops up somewhere. There is a happy ending to the video because he does find it. \n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c3a87a66d4d677acb9c2d01b19a60c48b403014","amp;dn":"King+Missile+-+Detachable+Penis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c3a87a66d4d677acb9c2d01b19a60c48b403014","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,58,135,166,109,77,103,122,203,156,45,1,177,154,96,196,139,64,48,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
