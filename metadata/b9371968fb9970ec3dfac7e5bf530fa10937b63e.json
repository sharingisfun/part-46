The sessions and the recording process for this album went out of control and took too long. They worked on the album for nine months. June 1969: the album was finished and got published in July.\n\nOn February 25th, 1969, they recorded &amp;quot;Rock is Dead&amp;quot;, a collage of different pieces of music put together in an hour-long session. They played blues, rock 'n' roll, latin. surf, something we later call rap, they did pop and even jazz.\n\nThe session published on this CD will blow your minds off. You'll hear the complete uncut version of the Doors' Rock is Dead -session, including TWO very different versions of another song the band intended to put on The Soft Parade: &amp;quot;Whiskey, Mystics and Men&amp;quot;, published for the first time on record.\n\nWhat you have in your hands now is the real thing. Uncut, no overdubs, in it's best available soundquality. &amp;quot;Mystic Man&amp;quot; should be placed right between &amp;quot;Waiting For the Sun&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The Soft Parade&amp;quot;.\n\n   \nDOORS Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½MYSTIC MANÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\nOn The Air OTA 005, Japan 1995 1 cd\n\n1   &amp;gt; Whiskey, Mystics And Men#1\n2   &amp;gt; The Soft Parade Intro#1\n3   &amp;gt; The Soft Parade Intro#2\n4   &amp;gt; Whiskey, Mystics And Men#2\n5   &amp;gt; Love Me Tender\n6   &amp;gt; Rock Is Dead#1\n7   &amp;gt; Me And The Devil Blues\n8   &amp;gt; Rock Is Dead#2\n9   &amp;gt; Queen Of The Magazines\n10 &amp;gt; Pipeline\n11 &amp;gt; Rock Is Dead#3/Rock Me Baby\n12 &amp;gt; Mystery Train\n13 &amp;gt; Rock Is Dead#4\n14 &amp;gt; Someday Soon\n15 &amp;gt; Orange County Suite\n\nSources:\nElektra Recorders StudioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, LA, Studio sessionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s for the Soft Parade\nCenter Coliseum, Seattle, June 5 1970\nPoetry session, March 1969\n\nMP3 VBR\nAudiograbber 1.82\nLAME 3.93\n\nMy other posts:\n\nhttp://www.piratebay.se/torrents-details.php?id=3314982&amp;amp;hit=1\n\nhttp://www.piratebay.se/torrents-details.php?id=3315182\n\nhttp://www.piratebay.se/torrents-details.php?id=3315657\n \nhttp://www.piratebay.se/torrents-details.php?id=3315737\n\nKeep them alive and I'll bring you more goodies soon...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9371968fb9970ec3dfac7e5bf530fa10937b63e","amp;dn":"The+Doors+-+Mystic+Man+-+The+Uncut+Soft+Parade+Sessions+1968-69","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9371968fb9970ec3dfac7e5bf530fa10937b63e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,55,25,104,251,153,112,236,61,250,199,229,191,83,15,161,9,55,182,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
