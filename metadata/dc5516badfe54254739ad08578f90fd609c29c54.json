He returns for the funeral of his brother Richard 'Richie' after a car crash during a storm, atypical of the careful house-father. Talking to the widow, daughter Doreen and enigmatic Geraldine, Jack suspects it was murder. Cliff Brumby, whose club Richie ran, is financially linked to porn and prostitution baron Cyrus Paice, who claims to be just a front-man for ITC tycoon Jeremy Kinnear. Someone hired goon Thorpey to make Jack return to Las Vegas. There Jack's partner Les Fletcher is restless, apparently about their boss Con McCarty whose wife had an affair with Jack. Someone breaks into Richie's home, looking for a crucial CD. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0208988/?ref_=ttpl_pl_tt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0208988/?ref_=ttpl_pl_tt&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIMBD Rating 5.0\n\nDownload and Enjoy\n\n\nKeep seeding ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc5516badfe54254739ad08578f90fd609c29c54","amp;dn":"Get+Carter+2000+dvdrip+%28+Hariwan%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc5516badfe54254739ad08578f90fd609c29c54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,85,22,186,223,229,66,84,115,154,208,133,120,249,15,214,9,194,156,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
