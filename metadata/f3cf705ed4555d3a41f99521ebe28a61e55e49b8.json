The fact that The Tangent are also an excellent live band is demonstrated in a very special manner on their first DVD ÃƒÂ¢??Going Off On OneÃƒÂ¢??.\n\nRecorded in a relaxed atmosphere at a club in the UK at Southend on Sea in Sept 2006, this DVD shows how much fun prog live shows can be and of course, what essential role the synthesiser in this genre plays ÃƒÂ¢?? frontman and keyboardist Andy Tillison is a master of his trade, who simply knows how to tease out goose bumps sounds of an old analogue gem.\n\nThe DVD contains a bonus live recording of TillisonÃƒÂ¢??s first band, which was formed in 1981. \n\nBand\nSam Baine (Keyboards, vocals)\nKrister Jonsson (E-guitars)\nGuy Manning (Acoustic guitar, vocals)\nJonas Reingold (Bass)\nJaime Salazar (Drums)\nAndy Tillison (Organ, synthesizers,vocals)\nTheo Travis (Saxophone)\n\n\ntracklist:\n1.
