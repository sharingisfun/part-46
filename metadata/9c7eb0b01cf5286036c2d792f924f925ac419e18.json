It's a\n        graphic tale  of the  violence, the  blood, the  fear, and the\n        insanity of war.\n\n        These kids are  underdogs, they're not  going to win  the war,\n        they're more likely to  end up dead in  a ditch than send  the\n        enemy  retreating,  but  it's their  land,  their  parents and\n        friends in prison  camps. They give  a damn and  they'd rather\n        die fighting than give up. \n\n\n\n        What we are looking for:\n\n        * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n        * Fios x264 rippers or cappers\n        * Internal 100mbit 1tb+ dump sites for Exlusive group usage","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c7eb0b01cf5286036c2d792f924f925ac419e18","amp;dn":"Tomorrow.When.The.War.Began.2010.1080p.BluRay.x264-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c7eb0b01cf5286036c2d792f924f925ac419e18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,126,176,176,28,245,40,96,54,194,215,146,249,36,249,37,172,65,158,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
