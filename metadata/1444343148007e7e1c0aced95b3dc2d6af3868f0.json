Although rampant unemployment, alcoholism and domestic violence are the norm for many reservation inhabitants, Rudy has largely escaped this cycle of despair. His brother Mogie, however, has not. Now faced with the discovery of a bloodied body, a flaming liquor store just off native land that sells millions of cans of beer a year to the native population, and his brother\\&amp;#039;s ongoing self-destruction, Rudy goes on a quest to avenge himself, his family, and his culture and to seek justice.\n\nGraham Greene, Eric Schweig, Gary Farmer, Noah Watts.\n\n\n2002 87 min.
