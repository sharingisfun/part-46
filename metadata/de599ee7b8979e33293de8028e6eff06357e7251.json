It's an old school arcade game slung into the 21st century. Highlights include a customizable playing arena, HUD, unique graphics, and AI bots. For the more advanced players there are new game modes and a wide variety of physics settings to tweak as well.\n\nThe upcoming release, 0.2.8.3, contains multiple bug fixes, restoring gameplay to as it was originally intended. But, it also contains enhancements multiplying the possibilities. Why play in a box? Play in a cross, an octagon or even in a hexagon flower. Don't just turn at 90 degrees, turn at 60, 120, or any other angle you can imagine. Looking farther ahead, don't just play in a standard arena, play in a arena disguised as a park! A castle! Anything you can imagine! There's even much, much more!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://armagetronad.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://armagetronad.net&lt;/a&gt;\nhttp://lightfoot.dashjr.org/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de599ee7b8979e33293de8028e6eff06357e7251","amp;dn":"Armagetron+Advanced+%28ALPHA+RELEASE+LEAK%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de599ee7b8979e33293de8028e6eff06357e7251","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,89,158,231,184,151,158,51,41,61,232,2,142,110,255,6,53,126,114,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
