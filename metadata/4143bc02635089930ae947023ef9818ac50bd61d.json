For more information about the film, head over to the Western Gold page.\n\nMountains and Water Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“I would unhesitatingly recommend this film to anyone who cares about the sport of climbing, even those who donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t boulder. At an hour and a half, plus some excellent bonus material, Western Gold offers a voyage of discovery that few other films can match.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nLloyd Climbing Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The entire film has been meticulously crafted with an attention to detail unmatched in other bouldering filmsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Almost all bouldering films have at least one song, scene, or story that I find distracting or annoying, but this one doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. It renews my hope for the genre.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4143bc02635089930ae947023ef9818ac50bd61d","amp;dn":"Western+Gold+%28climbing+movie%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4143bc02635089930ae947023ef9818ac50bd61d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,67,188,2,99,80,137,147,10,233,71,2,62,249,129,138,197,11,214,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
