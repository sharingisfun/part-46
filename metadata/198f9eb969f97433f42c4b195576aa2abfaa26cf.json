However, nearly all discussions of dinosaurs in museums and textbooks assume a distant evolutionary beginning to the earth. How can Christians reconcile apparent scientific consensus with the biblical creation story?\n\nDonald DeYoung demonstrates that evolution is not the only explanation for the existence and death of dinosaurs. He uses a question-and-answer format, supplemented by tables and figures, to offer the creationist explanation. The fifty questions include:\n\n-What was the diet of dinosaurs?\n-What happened to dinosaurs in the creation view?\n-Did dinosaurs evolve into birds?\n\nAppropriate for more advanced students, this book is a useful reference for home school and Sunday school teachers, parents, and anyone interested in dinosaurs.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nDonald B. DeYoung chairs the Natural Science Division at Grace College in Winona Lake, Indiana, where he resides. He is also on the faculty of the Institute for Creation Research, San Diego. DeYoung writes and speaks on creation topics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:198f9eb969f97433f42c4b195576aa2abfaa26cf","amp;dn":"Dinosaurs+and+Creation+-+Donald+DeYoung","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"198f9eb969f97433f42c4b195576aa2abfaa26cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,143,158,185,105,249,116,51,244,44,75,25,85,118,170,42,191,170,38,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
