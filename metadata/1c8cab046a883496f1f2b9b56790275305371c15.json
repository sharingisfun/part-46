Extra\n\n\n\n##########################################################################\n#   1   -   Recovery\n##########################################################################\nIs Windows failing to boot after you installed the loader? Just do the following.\n\n* Boot up the PC from your Windows installation disk\n* Select the &quot;Repair your computer&quot; option\n* Select &quot;Command Prompt&quot;\n* Input &quot;bootsect.exe /nt60 SYS /force&quot; (without quotes)\n* Restart the PC\n\nNote: If the above doesn't fix your boot issue then use the command &quot;bootsect.exe /nt60 ALL /force&quot; instead. Just make sure you remove all USB flash drives before you use the command.\n\n\n\n##########################################################################\n#   2   -   Genuine status\n##########################################################################\nHave you installed the loader but you're not genuine? Just check the following.\n\n* Check the details line contains &quot;v2.1&quot;\n* Try to validate online at http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate/\n\nNote: If the details line doesn't read v2.1 then go to the advanced tab, select to disable type 4 memory and reinstall the loader. If that doesn't work then use the legacy mode instead.\n\n\n\n##########################################################################\n#   3   -   Questions and answers\n##########################################################################\nQ. The loaders status says &quot;Unsupported partition table&quot;, why is this?\nA. You're either using GPT on a UEFI motherboard or you've got a locked OEM partition. Both problems can be fixed by fully formatting your entire hard drive.\n\nQ. I received the error message &quot;Error finding your systems active partition&quot;, what do I have to do?\nA. You need to format the whole hard drive with a program like Active@ Kill Disk. This issue is caused by your locked OEM partition. http://software.lsoft.net/boot-cd-iso.zip\n\nQ. I received the error message &quot;Failed to add loader to the boot code&quot;, what do I have to do?\nA. Disable any system protection. Some types of software block the loader application from installing to the boot code.\n\nQ. I've used a version of the loader before and it failed to work, what do I have to do?\nA. If you previously used bootsect to get back into Windows then you first need to press uninstall, reboot and then install the newest version of the loader.\n\nQ. Why was table sorting changed so that it's now disabled by default?\nA. Some machines don't like the table order being changed so to make the loader more system compatible we disabled it by default.\n\nQ. I've previously used another activation solution and I think it's modified my systems files, can I fix it?\nA. You can first try to uninstall what you originally installed and then try running &quot;sfc.exe /scannow&quot; from command prompt as an administrator.\n\nQ. I've got Linux on another partition/drive, is there anything I should know?\nA. Use the preserve current boot code option.\n\nQ. How can I use BitLocker, TrueCrypt or another boot manager?\nA. First setup the software and then install the loader with the option selected to preserve the current boot code.\n\nQ. I lose activation status after my systems been to sleep or has been in hibernation, can I fix it?\nA. Go to the advanced options and select to disable type 4 memory, install the loader again and see if that cures it. If you're not cured try to disable type 3 memory instead. If it still fails try selecting the legacy setting.\n\nQ. I installed the loader and my system hangs during the boot process, can I fix it?\nA. Go to the advanced options and select to disable type 4 memory, install the loader again and see if that cures it. If you're not cured try to disable type 3 memory instead. If it still fails try selecting the legacy setting.\n\nQ. I installed the loader and rebooted but I'm not activated. The loader application displays the message &quot;BAD SLIC SIZE&quot; or &quot;BAD SLIC DATA&quot;, can I fix it?\nA. Uninstall the loader, power down and then boot up the system again. Go to the applications advanced options and select to ignore the existing SLIC and then press install.\n\nQ. Why not use an E edition of Windows 7?\nA. Because they were never officially released and I can't guarantee the E editions will remain activated.\n\n\n\n##########################################################################\n#   4   -   UEFI motherboards\n##########################################################################\nThe loader doesn't work when the systems using GPT via UEFI. The workaround is to pre-format your hard drive so that it uses MBR instead.\n\nFrom your BIOS select to boot the Windows DVD without UEFI, go to the repair options, select command prompt and then enter this:\n\ndiskpart\nlist disk\nselect disk 0\nclean\nconvert mbr\ncreate partition primary\nselect partition 1\nformat fs=ntsf quick\n\nBoot the Windows DVD the same way you did the first time and then continue with the installation of Windows. Once complete you can install the loader.\n\n\n\n##########################################################################\n#   5   -   Checksums\n##########################################################################\nFile   : Windows Loader.exe\nCRC-32 : ce69f317\nMD4    : bf2ac69c1f9d86a6ca87bed82ae2aa10\nMD5    : ab6675956f434085e7a387c7c76e8ceb\nSHA-1  : 7f43f07e5babb7f60da48a4e6457f1cccb6fee83\n\n\n\n##########################################################################\n#   6   -   Changes\n##########################################################################\nVersion 2.0.9\n* Added a new GRLDR version\n* Added NTFS checks for the active system partition\n* Added Paradigit SLIC and certificate\n* Added Paradigit Home Premium serial\n* Added ZT Systems Home Premium serial\n* Added NEC Ultimate serial\n* Other minor tweaks and fixes\n\nVersion 2.0.8\n* Fixed a bug that prevented external SLIC's and certificates from loading\n* Fixed a bug that prevented the AT Computers profile from working\n* Added BGH e-Nova SLIC and certificate\n* Added BGH e-Nova Professional serial\n\nVersion 2.0.7\n* Added a new GRLDR version\n* Added Hyper-V support\n* Added Quanmax Professional serial\n* Added Stone Ultimate, Professional, Home Basic and Starter serials\n* Further enhanced partition identification\n* Fixed a bug in the uninstall function\n* Fixed access to the recovery menu (Hold 'R' during boot)\n* Other minor tweaks and fixes\n\nVersion 2.0.6\n* Added a new GRLDR version\n* Fixed the ignore existing SLIC option\n* Added Stone Home Premium serial\n* Added Itautec Home Basic serial\n* Added Stone and Itautec SLIC's and certificates\n* Cleaned up serials for all Windows Server editions\n* Other minor tweaks and fixes\n\nVersion 2.0.5\n* Added a new GRLDR version\n* Added a new option to patch all OEM table ID's\n* Added CCE, Chuangzhicheng and Crea SLIC's and certificates\n* Added CCE Windows 7 Professional serial\n* Added KSystems and Crea Windows 7 Starter serials\n* Changed the way partitions are identified which should fix boot issues for systems with hidden OS partitions\n\nVersion 2.0.4\n* Added a new GRLDR version\n* Recoded around 30% of the application so that the UI can always remain displayed\n* Added progress indicators\n* Added LG Starter serial\n* Added HP and IBM Windows Small Business Server 2011 Standard serials\n* Added Kraftway and Philco Home Premium serials\n* Added Philco profile\n* Other minor tweaks and fixes\n\nVersion 2.0.3\n* Added a new GRLDR version\n* Removed the prompt to ignore invalid SLIC's and have made the setting apply for Samsung systems only\n* Other minor tweaks and fixes\n\nVersion 2.0.2\n* Added a new GRLDR version\n* Added TAROX Ultimate, Professional, Home Premium and Starter serials\n* Fixed a bug that caused the wrong certificate to be dumped on some machines\n* Added a prompt to ignore the existing SLIC on a system if the SLIC is invalid\n* Other minor tweaks and fixes\n\nVersion 2.0.1\n* Added a new GRLDR version\n* Added TAROX and Vestel SLIC's\n* Added Positivo and Kraftway Home Basic serials\n* Enhanced the installation of GRLDR\n* Enhanced the dump option so that it will now dump the certificate and serial as well as the SLIC\n* Other minor tweaks and fixes\n\nVersion 2.0.0\n* Fixed a bug that could cause the application to crash\n* Fixed unicode character input for OEM information editing\n\nVersion 1.9.9\n* Fixed sandbox bug\n\nVersion 1.9.8\n* Added a new GRLDR version\n* Added OEM branding options\n* Added AT Computers, Genuine &amp;
