The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.\n\nOn the LIVE Sunday, October 14 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex discusses the outlandish medical practice of misdiagnosing children with ADHD to justify psychotropic drug prescriptions with investigative reporter and writer Jon Rappoport. He also breaks down the escalating tensions between Turkey and Syria potentially foreshadowing World War III and the manufactured collapse of American and other world economies. We'll also cover the Internet firestorm of tweets and Facebook posts from people pledging to riot if Obama loses the election, as covered in Michael Snyder's article &quot;Will the Election Results Cause Massive Riots to Erupt All Over America?&quot; \n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa326d312e90723a18bc6f38eed46ef62d2d5590","amp;dn":"Alex+Jones+Show+-+2012+Oct+14+SU+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa326d312e90723a18bc6f38eed46ef62d2d5590","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,50,109,49,46,144,114,58,24,188,111,56,238,212,110,246,45,45,85,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
