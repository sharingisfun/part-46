On February 11, 1984, the single reached #9 in the UK Singles Chart and on March 17, it reached #10 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.\n\nInexplicably, it did not chart well in Australia and Scandinavia; territories where its predecessor, &quot;Union of the Snake&quot;, had been a big hit. This trend was reversed with the next single, &quot;The Reflex&quot;, which became a worldwide number one.\n\nThe music video for &quot;New Moon on Monday&quot; was filmed by director Brian Grant during the icy first week of January 1984, in the village of Noyers in France. It has a loosely sketched storyline in which the band appear as underground rebels, organizing a revolt against an oppressive militaristic regime.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:979d14fe31c1646f8ae369c150dd12e8043f06c1","amp;dn":"Duran+Duran+-+New+Moon+On+Monday","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"979d14fe31c1646f8ae369c150dd12e8043f06c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,157,20,254,49,193,100,111,138,227,105,193,80,221,18,232,4,63,6,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
