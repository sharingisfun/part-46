This includes the 1.1 and the 1.1.1 patch. Hope you guys enjoy and please help seed.\n\nAlso will be uploading the latest version of Wasteland 2 for you guys later tonight.\n\n\n----------------\n\n\nChangelog for version 1.1.1:\n\n\nVersion 1.1.1 contains the following fixes:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Bloom effect on Chinese lamps and Crowboy map in Europolis. For some reason these went missing in v1.1. They are back!\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢German voice-overs. A large number of German voice files mysteriously vanished from the previous version. We apologise for that. They are also back!\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢A save-game bug that made it possible to travel back in time if you visited the biolab while on the campaign trail. This only happened if players loaded a previously saved game and went back to the biolab during a particular point in the story.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢If you walk away from Arn Stont in Friar's Keep without responding to his pleas, your choice will now be properly summarised at the end of the game (it was already remembered by the game, so you do not have to replay the game for this choice to take effect).\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Floating characters in Europolis when loading a pre-v1.1 save-game. These characters have been groundedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦literally.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢A bug in Pandemonium where a rogue second camera caused a severe performance hit. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Frame-rate should be higher in Mira's shop now.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Broken collision in House of All Worlds, allowing the player character to walk outside the world. This hole-in-the-world has been plugged.\n\n\n----------------------\n\n\nAnd here is a reminder about what we fixed in yesterday's v1.1 patch:\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢'The Story So Far' recap video available from the main menu: watch a three-minute summary of Dreamfall: The Longest Journey.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Reduced memory usage, particularly in Europolis.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Improved overall performance.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Fixed stuck on black screen when loading into certain scenes (e.g. Pandemonium).\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Fixed shaders that sometimes caused graphical artefacts on all platforms.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Altered some visual effects on Mac and Linux that were causing black artefacts (e.g. in opening cinematic).\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢More granular options in graphics settings (e.g. disable depth-of-field, change shadow draw-distance).\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Updated German subtitles and voice overs, and updated French subtitles\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Improved localised menu interface.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Fixed random failure to retrieve list of Facebook friends.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Always syncs with Steam Cloud when game exits.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Support for Xbox One controller in Windows verified. Make sure you are using the official Microsoft drivers.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢'Consequence notification' for the most important choice in the game: ZoÃƒÂ«'s career.\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/dreamfall_chapters_season_pass_special_edition&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/dreamfall_chapters_season_pass_special_edition&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e005c01227d9d82df0456e22cd065ca0969dc03","amp;dn":"Dreamfall+Chapters+%28Book+One%29+%28Linux%29+%281.1.1+Patch%29+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e005c01227d9d82df0456e22cd065ca0969dc03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,0,92,1,34,125,157,130,223,4,86,226,44,208,101,202,9,105,220,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
