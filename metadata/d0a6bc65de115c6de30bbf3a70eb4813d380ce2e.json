Kim adds her superb touch and exquisite arrangements to the timeless beauty of traditional Irish, Welsh and Scottish folk songs including Foggy Dew, Bally Loo Lammy and Gartan Mother's Lullaby, to the classical grace of J.S. Bach's Sheep May Safely Graze, to the title tune, from the Broadway musical Peter Pan -- one of the sweetest lullabies we know. On Tender Shepherd, Kim magically combines meditative and sprightly moods to offer us a soothing time-out from a busy world, conjuring a truly peaceable kingdom in which, as on the album cover, lions lie down with lambs.\n\nKim Robertson - Tender Shepherd\n\n01 - Cradle Song\n02 - Bernard the Butterfly\n03 - Let It Be a Dance\n04 - Bally Loo Lammy\n05 - The Price of My Pig\n06 - Sheep May Safely Graze\n07 - The Foggy Dew\n08 - All the Pretty Little Horses\n09 - Quiet Land of Erin\n10 - All Through the Night\n11 - Highland Lullaby\n12 - Gartan Mother's Lullaby\n13 - Irish Lamentation\n14 - Tender Shepherd","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0a6bc65de115c6de30bbf3a70eb4813d380ce2e","amp;dn":"Kim+Robertson+-+Tender+Shepherd+%281992%29+%5BMP3+V2%5D+Celtic+harp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0a6bc65de115c6de30bbf3a70eb4813d380ce2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,166,188,101,222,17,92,109,227,11,191,58,112,235,72,19,211,128,206,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
