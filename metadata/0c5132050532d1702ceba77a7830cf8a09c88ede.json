It is a free program that allows you to take video and audio files and convert them into MKV files on the fly, making it a very quick conversion.\n\nOpen MKVMerge on your computer, and you will be greeted by its home menu. Click the &quot;Add&quot; button that is near the top of the program, and a new window will appear giving you access to your computer's files. Locate your MP4 video and select it. Press &quot;Open,&quot; and it will load into MKVMerge.\n\nPress the &quot;Browse&quot; button at the bottom of the program, and a window will appear. Locate a place on your computer to save the new MKV file after it is created. Once you have found a place, click &quot;Save&quot; to save the location. Click the &quot;Start Muxing&quot; button at the bottom of the program and your MKV file will be created. Depending on the size of the file, it could take a few minutes. Once it is finished locate the MKV file after the program congratulates you on the conversion and play it as you would any other video file.\n\n\nTo ensure that you can get proper playback be sure you have installed the K-lite codec pack full version or mega version both of which comes with Media Player Classic Home Cinema and configure it properly for .mkv playback. If you do not have it you can get it here below: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Codec_Pack.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Codec_Pack.htm&lt;/a&gt; \n\nOnce installed you can playback the .mkv file with the following players:\n\nMedia Player Classic, Power DVD, or Windows Media Player. \n\nVLC player doesnt play the MKV video only the audio for some unknown reason, so use the above players or you can burn the .mkv video file to a DVD -R disc or load it onto a USB flash drive and play it back on any BluRay player that is MKV compatible and has a USB port like my Panasonic DMP BD75 BluRay player and LG BP620 3D BluRay player does.\n\nEnjoy the WWE Monday Night Raw Supershow wrestling fans and thanks for downloading my WWE Monday Night Raw Supershow 2012-12-24 720p AVCHD-SC-SDH release. \n\n\nThis show may be my last SC-SDH release for awhile so Please check out my latest blog comments for more info at: \n\n\nUploaded by SCSA420 on ThePirateBay.se and KickAss Torrents\n\n\nHappy Holidays and Merry Christmas everyone I hope you all have a nice Christmas and Holiday season.\n\n\nStoneCold420 \nSmackDownHotel\nDecember 24, 2012\n\nFor the older SDH wrestling torrents home page go here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/VinceMcMahon316&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/VinceMcMahon316&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAnd for other SDH wrestling releases and other SDH releases go here:   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/AhsokaTano&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/AhsokaTano&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor 2012 SDH releases up to 2012-03-26 please go here:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/SC420&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/SC420&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor 2012 SDH releases from 2012-03-29 onward please check here:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/SCSA420&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/SCSA420&lt;/a&gt;  \n\n  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c5132050532d1702ceba77a7830cf8a09c88ede","amp;dn":"WWE+Monday+Night+Raw+Supershow+2012-12-24+720p+AVCHD-SC-SDH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c5132050532d1702ceba77a7830cf8a09c88ede","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,81,50,5,5,50,209,112,44,235,167,122,120,48,207,138,9,200,142,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
