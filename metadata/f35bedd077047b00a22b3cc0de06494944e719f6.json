While their nations battled in the field, these warlords of the twentieth century waged a private war of the mind. From Whitehall and Washington to the WolfÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Lair and the Kremlin, Warlords documents their psychological battles and the attempts to outthink and outfight one another. Like a cinematic thriller, rapidly cutting from one man to the next, the narrative reveals each leader as they face historyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest conflict-and each other.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f35bedd077047b00a22b3cc0de06494944e719f6","amp;dn":"Warlords++%282007+-+Retail+epub+and+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f35bedd077047b00a22b3cc0de06494944e719f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,91,237,208,119,4,123,0,162,43,60,192,222,6,73,73,68,231,25,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
