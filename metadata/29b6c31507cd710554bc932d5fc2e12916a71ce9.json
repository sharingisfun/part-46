Here is Star Wars Despecialized v2.7, the final release of the officially sanctioned (as in, by Harmy) updates to Despecialized v2.5 including upgraded shots and alternate color timing.\r\n\r\nComparison Gallery: http://picsurge.com/g/cCwnAo (many more color changes were made than shown here)\r\n\r\nBrief Description of updates:\r\nDespecialized v2.5 Recolorized was released first as a test to adjust the color timing of v2.5, in order to remove some of the heavy color bias that was inspired by a Technicolor scan that turned out not to have been corrected yet. v2.6 quickly followed, which included some shots from Team Negativeâ€™s 35mm release, after being cleaned and adjusted, to replace GOUT-based shots of v2.5.\r\n\r\nDespecialized v2.7 incorporates many more color adjustments to remove some of the green timing in some desert shots, Death Star interiors, and more. Additionally, it was encoded from Harmyâ€™s lossless master file, meaning no generational video quality loss. A few mistakes were found in v2.6 and corrected, including color issues and the fact that some Mos Eisley shots were accidentally taken from GOUT sources, and not 35mm. Some Despecializing enhancements were made as well. Namely, the lightsaber in Benâ€™s hut was rotoscoped from 35mm, the â€œA Long Time Agoâ€ card is a cleaned 35mm sequence, and the Greedo subtitles have been rebuilt based on Team Negativeâ€™s 35mm release.\r\n\r\nPrevious versions:\r\n2.5: http://www.myspleen.org/details.php?id=12227\r\n2.5 Recolorized: http://www.myspleen.org/details.php?id=20496\r\n2.6: http://www.myspleen.org/details.php?id=20673\r\n\r\nMore information can be found here:\r\n \nhttp://originaltrilogy.com/forum/topic.cfm/Harmys-STAR-WARS-Despecialized-Edition-HD/topic/12713/\r\n\r\n\r\nVIDEO SOURCES:\r\n\r\n1) STAR WARS Episode IV A New Hope Official Blu-Ray 2011 (Preliminary colour correction by You_Too)\r\n\r\n2) STAR WARS 2006 Bonus DVD (sourced from the 1993 Definitive Edition Laser Disc Master - upscales by Dark Jedi, You_Too and Harmy)\r\n\r\n3) Star.Wars.Episode.IV.A.New.Hope.1977.720p.HDTV.x264-DON (2004 DVD Version)\r\n\r\n4) STAR WARS 1997 Special Edition (Reivax DTV capture)\r\n\r\n5) Custom mattes, 35mm and 70mm film cell scans etc.\r\n\r\n6) Team Negative1 35mm &quot;Silver Screen Edition&quot;
