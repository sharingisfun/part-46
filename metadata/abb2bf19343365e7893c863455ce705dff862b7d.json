Born at Vlotho on the River Weser on 25 June, 1918, he joined the German Army at Northeim in September 1939 and served as an infantry soldier until he was captured in 1944. The major difference between him and so many thousands of his compatriots was that he survived and so did his photographic record of the places he went.&quot; &quot;Backing up the photographs are reminiscences and battle accounts from individual soldiers and official wartime reports. These examine every aspect of the daily life of a soldier - the bad times and the more fleeting good ones - the moments of sheer terror and those of comradeship. This book is not a tribute to war, but an honest attempt to explain what it was like to be a German infantry soldier during World War II","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abb2bf19343365e7893c863455ce705dff862b7d","amp;dn":"German+Infantryman+At+War+1939-1945","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abb2bf19343365e7893c863455ce705dff862b7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,178,191,25,52,51,101,231,137,60,134,52,85,206,112,93,255,134,43,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
