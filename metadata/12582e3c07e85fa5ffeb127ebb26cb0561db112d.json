The group was formed in Sydney in 1976 by ex-Buffalo guitarist Peter Wells and -- with the additions of former Buster Brown vocalist Angry Anderson, guitarist Mick Cocks, bassist Ian Rilen, and drummer Dallas &quot;Digger&quot; Royal -- made its public bow on New Year's Eve at the local club Chequers, which several years earlier launched the career of AC/DC. Chiefly inspired by the Rolling Stones and the Faces, Rose Tattoo's ferocious, ear-splitting sound quickly earned a devoted following among Sydney area pubgoers, and in 1978 the group signed to Albert Productions; its debut single, &quot;Bad Boy for Love,&quot; was written by Rilen, who left the lineup prior to the record's release. Anderson's onetime Buster Brown bassist Geordie Leach was recruited for Rose Tattoo's self-titled debut LP; after nearly three years of relentless touring, a period that saw Aussie guitar hero Lobby Loyde briefly replace Leach on bass, they issued the follow-up, Assault &amp; Battery, in 1981. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFlac (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.95% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tRepertoire\nCatalog:\t\tREP 4309-WG\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n01 -=- 01.Rock 'N' Roll Outlaw.flac -=- CDDA (100%)\n02 -=- 02.The Butcher And Fast Eddy.flac -=- CDDA (100%)\n03 -=- 03.Dead Set.flac -=- CDDA (100%)\n04 -=- 04.One Of The Boys.flac -=- CDDA (100%)\n05 -=- 05.Tramp.flac -=- CDDA (100%)\n06 -=- 06.Nice Boys.flac -=- CDDA (100%)\n07 -=- 07.Remedy.flac -=- CDDA (100%)\n08 -=- 08.Sidewalk Sally.flac -=- CDDA (100%)\n09 -=- 09.Scarred For Life.flac -=- CDDA (100%)\n10 -=- 10.We Can't Be Beaten.flac -=- CDDA (100%)\n11 -=- 11.It's Gonna Work Itself Out.flac -=- CDDA (100%)\n12 -=- 12.Branded.flac -=- CDDA (100%)\n13 -=- 13.Out Of This Place.flac -=- CDDA (100%)\n14 -=- 14.All The Lessons.flac -=- CDDA (99%)\n15 -=- 15.Assault And Battery.flac -=- CDDA (100%)\n16 -=- 16.Southern Stars.flac -=- CDDA (100%)\n17 -=- 17.Death Or Glory.flac -=- CDDA (100%)\n18 -=- 18.Magnum Maid.flac -=- CDDA (100%)\n19 -=- 19.Saturday's Rage.flac -=- CDDA (100%)\n20 -=- 20.The Radio Said Rock 'N' Roll Is Dead.flac -=- CDDA (100%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12582e3c07e85fa5ffeb127ebb26cb0561db112d","amp;dn":"Rose+Tattoo+-+Angry+Metal+20+Great+Tracks+%281993%29+%7BFLAC%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12582e3c07e85fa5ffeb127ebb26cb0561db112d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,88,46,60,7,232,95,165,255,235,18,126,187,38,203,5,97,219,17,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
