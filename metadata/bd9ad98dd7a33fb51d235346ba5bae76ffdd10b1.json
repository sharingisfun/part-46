The internationally known characters cover a range of historical periods, and each had an enormous influence on British history. \r\nThe series is presented by enthusiastic and engaging military expert Major Gordon Corrigan. Though each episode is stand alone, across the series Corrigan also address broader questions about what makes a great commander, allowing modern parallels to be drawn. Commanders featured are Henry V, the Duke of Marlborough, Admiral Nelson, General Douglas Haig, Oliver Cromwell and the Duke Of Wellington.\r\n\r\nProduced &amp; Directed by Emma Hawley ; A Granada Production for Five\r\n\r\n5)  Oliver Cromwell \r\nMajor Gordon Corrigan presents a profile of Oliver Cromwell, a captain who overcame his inexperience to lead his Roundhead forces to victory over the Cavaliers in the 17th century. Although most famous for deposing the monarchy and founding British democracy, Cromwell was also notorious for instigating a brutal invasion of Ireland.\r\nGiven his lack of background in soldiering, Oliver Cromwell's rise as a military commander was remarkably swift. He reached the top, as he did in politics. He became a Captain in 1642, a Colonel in early 1643, in charge of cavalry of one regional army by the end of that year. Lieutenant General of the New Model Army by 1645 and Lord General for the campaigns in Ireland and Scotland thereafter. Cromwell understood organisation, and that was what made him a good military commander. His belief in training and professionalism was what made the New Model Army what it was.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a8/Great-British-Commanders-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cc/Great-British-Commanders-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/89/Great-British-Commanders-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d2/Great-British-Commanders-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f6/Great-British-Commanders-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/96/Great-British-Commanders-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6e/Great-British-Commanders-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3a/Great-British-Commanders-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a5/Great-British-Commanders-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/25/Great-British-Commanders-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/62/Great-British-Commanders-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cb/Great-British-Commanders-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/51/Great-British-Commanders-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f9/Great-British-Commanders-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4c/Great-British-Commanders-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f2/Great-British-Commanders-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\r\nVideo Bitrate: 2527 kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 720x464\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.552:1\r\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\r\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\r\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\r\nAudio Streams: 2\r\nAudio Languages: english\r\nRunTime Per Part: 23 min\r\nNumber Of Parts: 6\r\nPart Size: 449 MB\r\nRipped by: DocFreak08\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nSource: \nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Great_British_Commanders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd9ad98dd7a33fb51d235346ba5bae76ffdd10b1","amp;dn":"Ch5+Great+British+Commanders+5of6+Oliver+Cromwell+XviD+AC3+MVGro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd9ad98dd7a33fb51d235346ba5bae76ffdd10b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,154,217,141,215,163,63,181,29,35,83,70,186,91,174,118,255,221,16,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
