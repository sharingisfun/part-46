Twenty-five years ago in Greenwood, Texas, a violent fire erupted in the tiny cotton-growing community. No one ever took responsibility and no one was ever caught. Instead, the town moved forward as if nothing happened. Today, the embers still smolder, but a reckoning may soon be on the horizon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9009430b44b1ec68e52828e3053a2582639f5ac","amp;dn":"Stephen+Graham+Jones-Growing+Up+Dead+in+Texas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9009430b44b1ec68e52828e3053a2582639f5ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,0,148,48,180,75,30,198,142,82,130,142,48,83,162,88,38,57,245,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
