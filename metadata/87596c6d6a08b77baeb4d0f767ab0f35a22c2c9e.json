Echolalia, named after the mental disorder that lets people          |\n|   express in a form of constant mimicking doesn't sum up this album quite    |\n|   right. Though as it is a double disc effort, there is a lot of filler.     |\n|                                                                              |\n|   The first disc features a majority of the highlight tracks, one of them    |\n|   being 'Monsters,' which was quite successful here in Aus, with its         |\n|   sweeping verses and quite light weight chorus. And lyrically Paul          |\n|   Dempsey is once again at his phenomenal best:                              |\n|                                                                              |\n|   I was hiding away under water                                              |\n|   Waiting for distance and buying some time                                  |\n|   Trying to be two hundred thousand years younger                            |\n|   So I could excuse myself from humankind                                    |\n|   'Cause I don't want to be a container                                      |\n|   Or a bastard with a ten page disclaimer                                    |\n|   But these monsters spin me around                                          |\n|   Get me down, just try and shut me out                                      |\n|                                                                              |\n|   The early parts of the record gives as a slickly produced sound that       |\n|   could probably sound a lot better live, though is glossed with studio      |\n|   perfection. As the record roles on we come to 'Feeding The Birds and       |\n|   Hoping for Something in Return' which begins with a march like drum        |\n|   beat, before the gloriously voiced Paul Dempsey directs the pattern in a   |\n|   different direction with his guitar work. 'Twenty Years' is probably the   |\n|   best song on the first disc with a very pop heavy feel, though it has a    |\n|   more rushed tempo, giving it a spine tingled feeling and a sense of        |\n|   urgency.                                                                   |\n|                                                                              |\n|   The second disc is full of live versions of the first disc, as well as     |\n|   some re recorded older material and is a bit scratchy in sections. While   |\n|   the live versions of some tracks are quite spectacular, it doesn't have    |\n|   the nice coherent flow that the first disc does. While the album has       |\n|   some amazing standout tracks, like 'Monsters' 'Twenty Years' the fast      |\n|   paced 'Say Something' and odd 'Feeding The Birds and Hoping for            |\n|   Something in Return' it is plagued with filler, which is unfortunate       |\n|   since some of the good tracks are up there with Something For Kate's       |\n|   best.                                                                      |\n|                                                                              |\n|   On Echolalia Something For Kate are gasping for a wider playing arena,     |\n|   and have had some success with 'Monsters' but unfortunately it has         |\n|   probably come out as the bands weakest release to date. While the album    |\n|   is slickly produced, it doesn't seem quite full enough, or it's missing    |\n|   something vital, though it is a Something For Kate album, so whatever      |\n|   the lows may be, there are still a lot of highs.
