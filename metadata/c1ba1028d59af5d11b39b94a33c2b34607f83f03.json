The group consisted of two strong songwriting teams with different approaches: The more commercial part Goldman/Stewart and the artistic couple Godley/Creme. &quot;Somewhere in Hollywood&quot; or &quot;One Night in Paris&quot; prove the four guy's ability in creating not only nice ditties but also complex and astounding pop-jewels.\nAfter the departure of Godley and Creme in 1976, despite the band's further commercial success, the demise was inevitable.\n\nAlbums:\n\n1973 - 10CC\n1974 - Sheet Music\n1975 - The Original Soundtrack\n1976 - How Dare You!\n\nTo some albums rare bonus tracks had been added later. I call them &quot;The Holy Crap&quot;, but nevermind, they're hard to find and i don't have them in FLAC. They are located in a separate MP3-folder.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1ba1028d59af5d11b39b94a33c2b34607f83f03","amp;dn":"10CC+-+First+Line-Up+%281972-1976%29+%5Bfixed%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1ba1028d59af5d11b39b94a33c2b34607f83f03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,186,16,40,213,154,245,209,27,57,185,74,51,194,179,70,7,248,63,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
