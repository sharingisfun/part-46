Unlike Brendel, he views Beethoven with a deep emotional richness that is quite apparent throughout the entire sonata cycle. \n\nBarenboim shows that he is as comfortable playing Beethoven's early sonatas such as the Pathetique as he is with the later, more complex works like the Hammerklavier. \n\nOnly Claudio Arrau and Wilhelm Kempff surpass Barenboim's combination of superb technique coupled with warm, passionate performances. \n\n\nMake sure you compare this cycle with the other complete sets which I have already uploaded!\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:171b06ae1544bbc9d5d1ddf053062df7f50b4a72","amp;dn":"Beethoven+-+Complete+Piano+Sonatas+-+Daniel+Barenboim","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"171b06ae1544bbc9d5d1ddf053062df7f50b4a72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,27,6,174,21,68,187,201,213,209,221,240,83,6,45,247,245,11,74,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
