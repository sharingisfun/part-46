Luckily, twenty-seven-year-old decorating prodigy Kyle Schuneman knows that a paper-thin wallet and four plain walls donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to stand in your way, and the ten amazing, real apartments in this book show it.\nFrom coast to coast, these fabulous first homes are the perfect balance between cool design and comfort, and they offer plenty of practical ideas for making your apartment feel open, organized, and inviting. Examples include:\n- Multifunctional studios\n- A loft that was sectioned into livable areas\n- Cookie-cutter apartments with one-of-a-kind personality\n- Shared spaces that accommodate different decorating tastes\n- Fantastic examples of how to display collections, hide unsightly stuff, and manage picky landlords\n\nKyleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s creative solutions reveal how you can make your space feel much larger than it really isÃ¢â‚¬â€and how it can reflect your passions, your travels, and your location. He will inspire you to use your surroundings for decorating ideas (think taxi-cab-yellow accents in New York or graffiti-like dip-dye curtains in Seattle). Short on time and long on style, the thirty DIY projects here include no-sew pillows and a dresser update using a little glue and decorative paper.\nFull of bold, vibrant photos, an extensive resource section, and hundreds of big ideas for small spaces, this book proves that there are no limits on how spacious and how cool your first apartment can feel.\n\nAbout the Author\nKYLE SCHUNEMAN is the founder of Live Well Designs in LA.
