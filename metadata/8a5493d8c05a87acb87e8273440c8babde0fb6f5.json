Vasilyev, K. Stanyukovich titled Matter and Man.\n\nThe book talks about the various aspects of matter and how man (humans!) has come to control them and use them. The book thematically explores solids, liquids,  gases, plasma, radiation, fields, gas dynamics and some aspects of cosmology and how can be they used in order to serve mankind.\n\n    Man is calculatingly inquisitive. As soon as he discovers a new law of nature he tries to exploit it for his own ends. Having discovered the secret of lightning bolts he uses it to produce electric light. Having learned the laws of river flow he digs irrigation canals and impounds artificial lakes which affect the very climate of whole regions. He has harnessed the power of nuclear fission of uranium and will soon learn to tame the thermonuclear reactions which heat the sun itself. When he discovers the laws of the universe he will surely put thern to work and make them serve him, He will reconstruct planetary systems,\n    move stars about and regulate their brightness. Man will indeed become the master of the universe, and it will serve him just as terrestrial laws and phenomena are serving\n    him today.\n\nThough today some of the things said seem to be naive, they were not when they had been said. For example the progress in space exploration, which observers in 1950-60s has predicted did not come through. Many of the things said in this book seem to be too optimistic, considering the current scenario. In the entire book the dominant ideology seems to be to exploit the natural resources for benefit of mankind. This is something which the Science Studies people detest, but at the time when the book was written they were not there. The book truly represents the zeitgeist of that era.\n\nSince the original cover was not available to me in hi-res, I have designed a new cover. If you have access to the original cover pictured above please do post (min. 600 dpi or more).\n\nThe book was translated from the Russian by V. Talmy and was first published by Peace Publishers (and earlier name for Mir, logo is the same) sometime in 1960s.\n\nYou can get the book here.\n\nPDF | OCR | 600 dpi| Bookmarked| Paginated| Covers | 182 pages| 17.1 MB\n\nReleased on TPB by mirtitles.org\n\n\nCONTENTS\nFace to Face (instead of introduction) 7\n\nThe Matter of the Universe\n\nA Search for Vacuum 15\nStates and Fields 25\nMan the Master 30\nSolids, Liquids and Gases 34\n\nPlasma\n\nThe Fourth State of  Matter 41\nSelf-constricting Discharge 46\nStellar Fuel 49\n\nField\n\nIntangible Matter 59\nOmnipresent Force 64\nDr. Einstein's Revolution 68\nThe Expanding Universe 73\nParticles of Gravity 77\nIn the Heart of the Atom 81\nFactories of Matter 83\nContinents Awaiting Their Columbuses 85\n\nMachines of Rays and Jets\n\nA Journey Into the Day After Tomorrow 91\nTake off From the Asteroid Pallas 100\nTrip to the Stars 105\nThe Time Paradox 110\n\nExplosion\n\nGas Dynamics  121\nGas Flow into Vacuum 125\nShock Waves 129\nExploding Stars 134\nCosmic Clouds  138\nSpeed as an Explosive 141\nExplosions at Work 144\n\nBiography of the Universe\n\nThe Day of Creation 153\nThe Family of Planets 159\nOne Turn of the Spiral 163\nMasters of the Universe (instead of a conclusion) 175","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a5493d8c05a87acb87e8273440c8babde0fb6f5","amp;dn":"Matter-and-Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a5493d8c05a87acb87e8273440c8babde0fb6f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,84,147,216,192,90,135,172,184,126,130,115,68,12,139,171,222,15,182,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
