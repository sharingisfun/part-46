Reason's legendary flagship synth delivers a thunderous sound, god-like sound sculpting capabilities and an innovative, lighting-fast keyboard designed for iPad. Thor is a synthesis playground, a flexible sonic workhorse, but above all, an expressive musical instrument for the iPad.\n\nThor sounds like no synthesizer you've ever heard beforeÃ¢â‚¬â€and every single one of them. Where other synths use one specific form of synthesis and one single filter, the Thor polysonic synthesizer features six different oscillator types and four unique filters. What does this give you? Simply the most powerful synth ever created; an unstoppable monster of a sound generator that utilises synthesizer technology from the last 40 years.\n\n\nA synth-geek's dream synth\n\nThor offers a deep and versatile synth app for your iPad. From its debut in Reason, Thor was designed as a synth geek's dream synth. Combine its selection of oscillator types, filter designs flexible routing and above all: a sound like nothing else. What you get is a true monster of a synth, capable of doing anything, yet easy to understand and quick to get started with. On the iPad, Thor's interface has been designed with tactile control in mind.\n\n                ____________________________________________________\n\nSupport the software creators ! \n\n________________\n\nSeed if you like !\n\n________________\n\nThanks to whoever cracked this thing.\nABOD.
