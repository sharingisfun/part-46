People that work with me told me it wasn't a great idea for an artist to write his own bio, but I figured if there was going to be someone introducing me to you, I'd just as soon have that someone be me. I grew up in suburban Oklahoma and moved to Nashville after college. It is strange and wonderful to me that I get to have a job writing songs and singing them. This part of a bio is where having someone else write it is a real bonus, because they go on and on about how great you are and how great things are going for you (not something I'm too keen at or fond of). I figure you'll be the judge of whether or not you think my music is any good regardless of whether someone that was hired to write a bio tells you it is, and as far as how things are going for me, I'd say I'm not really famous, but my mom isn't quite as worried about me being a musician as she used to be.&quot; - benrectormusic.com\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Songs That Duke Wrote (2008) [MP3 - 320kbps]\n----\n\n   01 - The Kill                        3:21\n \n   02 - The Sophomore                   2:24\n\n   03 - Associated                      3:22\n\n   04 - The Feeling                     4:13\n\n   05 - Ready for Change                3:51\n\n   06 - Need You Tonight                3:36\n\n   07 - After All                       3:52\n\n   08 - Early Morning Riser             3:11\n\n   09 - When She Comes Around           3:32\n\n   10 - Thank God I Miss You            2:48\n\n   11 - Untitled                        2:29\n\n   12 - Hank                            3:23\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Jingles And Bells - EP (2009) [MP3 - 320kbps]\n\n   01 - Let It Snow                     2:37\n\n   02 - Jingle Bells                    3:00\n\n   03 - Away in a Manger                1:32\n\n   04 - White Christmas                 2:47\n\n   05 - Silent Night                    2:22\n\n   06 - Auld Lang Syne                  2:47\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Into The Morning (2010) [MP3 - 320kbps]\n----\n\n   01 - The Beat                        3:37\n \n   02 - Loving You is Easy              3:09\n\n   03 - When a Heart Breaks             4:14\n  \n   04 - White Dress                     3:53\n\n   05 - Out of My Head                  3:19\n\n   06 - Autumn                          3:31\n\n   07 - Moving Backwards                3:10\n\n   08 - When I Get There                3:46\n\n   09 - And Then You Love Someone       3:52\n\n   10 - Dance With Me Baby              5:00\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Summer Candy - EP (2010) [MP3 - 320kbps]\n----\n\n   01 - Summer Candy - Side A           2:19\n\n   02 - Mr. Mailman - Side B            3:15\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Something Like This (2011) [MP3 - 320kbps]\n----\n\n   01 - Let the Good Times Roll         3:08\n\n   02 - Song for the Suburbs            3:40\n\n   03 - Never Gonna Let you Go          3:15\n\n   04 - Without You                     3:40\n\n   05 - Hide Away                       3:20\n\n   06 - You and Me                      3:57\n\n   07 - She Is                          3:24\n\n   08 - Wanna be Loved                  3:27\n \n   09 - Way I Am                        4:08\n\n   10 - Falling in Love                 2:44\n\n   11 - Home                            3:36\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The Walking In Between (2013) [MP3 - 320kbps]\n----\n\n   01 - Ordinary Love                   3:40\n\n   02 - When I'm With You               3:46\n\n   03 - Beautiful                       3:59\n\n   04 - Making Money                    3:20\n\n   05 - I Like You                      2:19\n\n   06 - Sailboat                        3:49\n\n   07 - Follow You                      3:39\n\n   08 - If You Can't Hear Me            3:32\n\n   09 - Wildfire                        2:58\n\n   10 - Forever Like That               4:14\n\n   11 - Life Keeps Moving On            3:17\n\n   12 - Thank God For The Summertime    3:22\n\n   13 - Forever Like That (Acoustic)    4:17\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3c69880a4b354d00ffba94fd52c05c9fc691500","amp;dn":"Ben+Rector+-+Discography+2008-2013+%28MP3+%40+320kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3c69880a4b354d00ffba94fd52c05c9fc691500","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,198,152,128,164,179,84,208,15,251,169,79,213,44,5,201,252,105,21,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
