You should always \nbe doing this anyways. A 500GB external hard drive is like $50 to \n$80, it's cheap! Buy one, it's more than worth it if you have valuable \ndata, it is mandatory for owning a computer!\n\n\nOn Cracks/Keygens...\n\nThere is no keygen, or crack, or anything like that in here! This is just a \nmuch slimmer, faster version of Windows 7 Ultimate x64, made from the original \nDVD. This is intended only to replace a current Windows 7 Ultimate x64. You \ncan use the same key. It will upgrade any version of Windows, though; you'll \njust need a Windows 7 Ultimate x64 key.\n\n\nAbout Drivers...\n\nIf wireless drivers do not automatically install, you may need to go online on \na different computer and download them and copy them to your computer using \nexternal storage. Alternatively, download your wireless drivers BEFORE \nreinstalling Windows, and save it on external media.\n\n\nNo 32-bit!\n\nThis is 64-bit (x64) and does NOT include the 32-bit (x86) version. If you \nhave an older computer without the ability to install a 64-bit operating \nsystem, then this is not for you.\n\n\nBACKGROUND INFO\n\nI have spent countless hours helping make peoples computers faster, and the \nmost time-consuming initial thing I do is disable all of the useless services \nthat either is not used (i.e. Telephony), or that is not compatible with the \nperson's computer (i.e. Tablet PC). You should notice remarkable performance \nincreases with this distribution.\n\nIn this release, I removed many useless things, but left a good number of \nthings intact, only tweaking the services to disable them on install. That \nway, if a user needs to use something in the future (i.e. Telephony is \nrequired for Remote Desktop, so removing it would remove that functionality; \nand Remote Desktop is required for watching TV through Windows Media Center, \nso removing either Telephony or Remote Desktop [among a number of other \nservices] would remove the ability to watch TV online through Windows Media \nCenter - actually a number of services were left and merely disabled for the \nsole purpose of allowing the possibility of Windows Media Center Online TV).\n\n\nMORE NOTES\n\nThis is 64-bit and does not include the 32-bit version. \n\nWindows 7 Ultimate x64 Everplex Slim and Fast\n\nThis is only intended to replace a current version of Windows 7 Ultimate x64. \nIt will upgrade any version of Windows, though; you'll just need a key. By all \nmeans, if possible, do a clean install! Clean installs are always best for \nreinstallation of a Windows operating system.\n\nEnjoy!!\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\nBurn .ISO to DVD.\nBoot it.\n\nRemember to back up your 64-bit wireless driver before reinstalling! That way you can get online to get any other drivers you might need to install.\n\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: Getting a boot.wim or flag 9 error?\nA: YOU CANNOT INSTALL THIS FROM WINDOWS. You have to Burn To Disc to install, and Boot Into The CD.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82b761576a5ef70e3a23447b741f705f0f5246ea","amp;dn":"-XBT-+Windows+7+Ultimate+x64+Everplex+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82b761576a5ef70e3a23447b741f705f0f5246ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,183,97,87,106,94,247,14,58,35,68,123,116,31,112,95,15,82,70,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
