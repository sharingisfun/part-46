It enables organizations to become resilient and agile, carefully calibrating their responses and adapting quickly to new circumstances in a fast-changing environment.\n\nThis book is the most comprehensive treatment to date of the scenario planning process. Unlike existing books it offers a thorough discussion of the evolution and theoretical foundations of scenario planning, examining its connections to learning theory, decision-making theory, mental model theory and more. Chermack emphasizes that scenario planning is far more than a simple set of steps to follow, as so many other practice-focused books doÃ¢â‚¬â€he addresses the subtleties and complexities of planning. And, unique among scenario planning books, he deals not just with developing different scenarios but also with applying scenarios once they have been constructed, and assessing the impact of the scenario project.\n\nUsing a case study based on a real scenario project Chermack lays out a comprehensive five phase scenario planning systemÃ¢â‚¬â€project preparation, scenario exploration, scenario development, scenario implementation and project assessment. Each chapter describes specific techniques for gathering and analyzing relevant data with a particular emphasis on the use of workshops to encourage dialogue. He offers a scenario project worksheet to help readers structure and manage scenario projects as well as avoid common pitfalls, and a discussion, based in recent neurological findings, of how scenario planning helps people to overcome barriers to creative thinking.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This book is about action and performance. Compelling and thoroughly researched, it offers every business executive a playbook for including uncertainty in the organizational change process and driving competitive advantageÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n-- Tim Reynolds, Vice President, Talent and Organization Effectiveness, Whirlpool Corporation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f883f86d8d5b0f2d112932a190def675e9f82e18","amp;dn":"Scenario+Planning+in+Organizations+-+How+to+Create%2C+Use%2C+and+Ass","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f883f86d8d5b0f2d112932a190def675e9f82e18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,131,248,109,141,91,15,45,17,41,50,161,144,222,246,117,233,248,46,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
