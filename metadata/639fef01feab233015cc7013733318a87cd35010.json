A lot of craft, and often much time, goes into their creation. Tolkien spent years refining The Lord of the Rings and even The Airtight Garage took Moebius four years to complete.\nThe preparation of this new American edition enabled us, however, to present what is a uniquely original, and hopefully definitive, version of this classic story, one that is not even available in France.\nThose familiar with previous incarnations of The Airtight Garage will immediately notice that the entire story is now in color. Coloring his black-and-white work had been on MoebiusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s agenda for yars. lt took, however, the occasion of this new collection to convince him that the time had come. So, with the heip of a few assistants, working under his direct supervision, Moebius completely colored every page, in the process, giving us an almost entirely new perspective on the material.\nIn addition to the coloring, the story itself was completely retranslated, again under MoebiusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s careful supervision, so that we could fix some internal inconsistencies that had cropped up during its making and that, to this day, still plague the original French version. Needless to say we were also able to reinstate some elements of continuity that had been lost in earlier American translations.\nWhich brings us to the matter of the lettering of the title of this story as it appears inside this book. Because the lettering is such an intrinsic part of the original art, and also because the word Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«hermeticÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» has a double meaning (both ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œairtightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and esotericÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) which we wanted to preserve, we have chosen to retain Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â»The Garage Hermetic of Lewis CamelianÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» as the inside title. Although, of course, this book will remain known forever under its more popular title of Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«The Airtight Garage.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â»\nlt is all a Bakalite trick.&quot;\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nATTENTION FELLOW PIRATES:\n\nSome *ssholes are performing automated swarm attacks on mine and other users torrents.
