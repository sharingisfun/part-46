Salisbury Plain (03:32)\n\nWhile many young artists fall into the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœnu-folkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ category, this album, above almost anything in recent memory feels like a bridge between old and new Ã¢â‚¬â€œ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s certainly a traditional folk disc but the interpretations are striking and fresh. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s even more impressive is that this interpretive innovation comes from LisaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s musicality rather than production techniques; she uses very traditional instrumentation throughout but approaches the songs from a different angle to her contemporaries. Even with this individuality she still manages to appeal to traditionalists as well as drawing in newcomers to folk music.\nCo-producer Gerry Diver and Lisa provide almost all of the instrumentation including acoustic guitar, hammered dulcimer, accordion, autoharp and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s memorable fiddle from Lisa throughout the disc.\nEight Ã¢â‚¬Ëœtrad. arrsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ sit alongside three of her own contemporary pieces and the quality is high throughout, in particular Ã¢â‚¬ËœBeggar BeggarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ has a sweet, soulful sound and a beautiful fiddle backing, and Ã¢â‚¬ËœBlacksmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, an 1825 York Broadside neatly sums up the album has it embraces both the traditional and the modern.\nWhat this album and Lisa have is confidence, the eleven songs pass by quickly but the range of styles and vocal performances show innovation and belief in her own musical sensibilities. An excellent album and highly recommended.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/01/18/lisa-knapp/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/01/18/lisa-knapp/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:961b512d5b8d68190a951736aa4dac893e636544","amp;dn":"Lisa+Knapp...Wild+and+Undaunted%282007%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"961b512d5b8d68190a951736aa4dac893e636544","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,27,81,45,91,141,104,25,10,149,23,54,170,77,172,137,62,99,101,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
