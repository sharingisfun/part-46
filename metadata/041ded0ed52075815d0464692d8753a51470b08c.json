Kennedy Montgomery is a libertarian that you may recognize from 90's MTV, Stossel, and the Independents.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nKennedy starts the night off solo talking more about immigration and the GOP. Trump continues as expected. Scott Walker seems to want a wall between us and Canada. Chris Christie wants immigrants tracked like FedEx packages. Rand Paul is doing something he could have done ages ago - setting up Students for Rand Paul.\n\nTonight's party panel consists of DEIRDRE BOLTON, JOE DeVITO, and DAVE SMITH. They continue talking about Rand Paul's recent college efforts. Then Scott Walker's Canadian wall talk. Blazing through they topics they quickly move onto Bernie Sanders nipping at Hillary's heels &amp; her polling problems. Some Biden talk, too.\n\nK-Walking: Kennedy hits the streets to ask what people think about Socialism. The panel discusses soon after.\n\nTIM SANDEFUR is here to discuss an overturned ruling in regards to the NSA running thier surveillance program. They probably back at it - for now. (Like they ever stopped, hah.)\n\nOur panel returns to talk about Obama renaming Mount Mckinley, George Clooney's wife Amal being referred to as &quot;actors wife&quot;, more deflategate blibber blabber.\n\nUK actor and generally attractive human ED SKREIN from &quot;The Transporter Refueled&quot; is in studio to talk about Transporter, filming, being underwater, Star Wars, pressure of living up to Jason Statham, and Ryan Renolds being the nicest guy you'll ever meet.\n\nNightcap: VMA Madness.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Kennedy.2015.08.31.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\nCodec ID                                 : isom\nFile size                                : 350 MiB\nDuration                                 : 42mn 6s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 161 Kbps\nWriting application                      : Lavf56.25.101\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : High@L3\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                                 : 42mn 6s\nBit rate                                 : 1 022 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 624 pixels\nHeight                                   : 352 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate                       : 9.990 fps\nMaximum frame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.155\nStream size                              : 308 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 142 r2389 956c8d8\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1022 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 40\nDuration                                 : 42mn 6s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 38.5 MiB (11%)\nLanguage                                 : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:041ded0ed52075815d0464692d8753a51470b08c","amp;dn":"Kennedy.2015.08.31.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"041ded0ed52075815d0464692d8753a51470b08c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,29,237,14,213,32,117,129,93,4,100,105,45,135,83,165,20,112,176,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
