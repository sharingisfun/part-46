The Millennial Bee or A Thousand-Year-Old Bee\n\nComedy / Drama / War\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086447/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086447/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPilsen Film Festival - WON - Golden Kingfisher\nVenice Film Festival - NOMINATED - Golden Lion\n\n\nAt the dawn of the twentieth century, before he dies, Martin Pichanda, a farmer, beekeeper and seasonal bricklayer, imparted to his two sons and daughter a whimsical wisdom of the world. Thereafter, the three siblings and their own offspring begin to follow divergent paths whilst still living close to each other. KristÃƒÂ­na is torn between her husband and an old flame, and when she is widowed, goes on to live in a mÃƒÂ©nage ÃƒÂ  trois with her lover and his awkward wife, subsequently bearing a child for all three of them. ValentÃƒÂ­n becomes a successful lawyer, which his pro-communist brother Samuel, a miller, views with resentment and suspicion, causing a divide that widens when the wealthier ValentÃƒÂ­n refuses to waive his part of their heritage. As decades and generations pass by, the ethnic and social tensions in the PichandaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s homeland of the Hapsburg Empire deepen. Samuel loses his eldest son following police action against leftist demonstrators and, subsequently, his second son, a talented painter, during World War I. As a result, he turns to terrorism, something that will have far-reaching consequences, both for himself and, crucially, for others.\n\nDespite a complex story, bewildering number of characters, and numerous surreal touches reminiscent of JakubiskoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s earlier films (for example a card game inside a whale, and a shower of frogs fifteen years before Paul Thomas AndersonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Magnolia), the allegory of A Thousand-Year-Old Bee was executed with such self-explanatory power and provided such a comforting myth of Slovak national history that it achieved unprecedented success within Czechoslovakia. Its ticket sales in Slovakia far outstripped any other Czechoslovak film in 1983, and it became the fifth highest grossing picture in Slovakia of all the Czechoslovak films made during in the last two decades of communism. Moreover, in a poll of Slovak and Czech film critics and academics taken over a decade after its release, it still ranked in the top five Slovak and top 25 Czechoslovak films ever made. As recently as 2002 the Slovaks still ranked JakubiskoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s film as their favourite domestic production ever, praise indeed for a magic-realist fable and exploration of the vagaries of myth, history and identity.\n\n\nVideo: XviD, 640x480, 25.000 fps, 1545 kbps, 02h41m34s\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, joint stereo, 192 kbps\n\noriginal Slovak, Czech audio\noptional Chinese, English, Spanish subtitles\n\nscreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/faGfCAAgB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/faGfCAAgB&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FAgFoaAgB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FAgFoaAgB&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDVDRip, found on D----r March 2014.
