The synthesizer-only intro is nearly 30 seconds long and you can hear Nick Nolte's dog Kerouac barking just before David Byrne begins singing.\n\nHope you enjoy it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4820ece80ed8e9d042a3ea00d8a03e7089e20f96","amp;dn":"Talking+Heads+-+Once+in+a+Lifetime+from+Down+and+Out+in+Beverly+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4820ece80ed8e9d042a3ea00d8a03e7089e20f96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,32,236,232,14,216,233,208,66,163,234,0,216,160,62,112,137,226,15,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
