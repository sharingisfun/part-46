In addition to the standard results of advanced calculus, the book contains several interesting applications of these results. The text is intended to form a bridge between calculus and analysis. It is based on the authors lecture notes used and revised nearly every year over the last decade. The book contains numerous illustrations and cross references throughout, as well as exercises with solutions at the end of each section","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48e9ad33faf911015a6e2909b2e96f3bb53384e9","amp;dn":"From+Calcul+Analysis+%5B2015%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48e9ad33faf911015a6e2909b2e96f3bb53384e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,233,173,51,250,249,17,1,90,110,41,9,178,233,111,59,181,51,132,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
