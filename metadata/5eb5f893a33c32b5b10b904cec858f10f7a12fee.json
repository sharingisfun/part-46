This re-mastered and re-packaged edition contains the same Chaplet of Divine Mercy that is seen on EWTN and also features the songs 'I am a Voice' and 'I Will Forgive' sung by Michael Bethea - who is often referred to by his fans as the man with a voice of an angel. \n\nThe Artist, Trish Short, Founder of Artists for Life, once described herself as a prochoice feminist. She began her journey back to faith after her life fell apart as the result of two failed marriages and two abortions. A former model and actress turned producer and director Ã¢â‚¬â€ Trish has spent the last 10 years producing videos and music for pro-life ministries all around the world through her production company, Winner Productions. Trish was first commissioned by the Marians of the Immaculate Conception in 2002 to direct and produce the best-selling contemporary Chaplet melody entitled Chaplet of Divine Mercy in Song. It was filmed at the National Shrine and still airs today on EWTN. In 2005, she began working in cooperation with the Marians again on Generations Unite in Prayer. If you loved the original, this 2nd edition calls on our LordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mercy with an even more powerful, prayerful devotional experience!\n\nMore: https://thepiratebay.se/user/ancapcatholic\n\nBTC: 1N3Y2HNWe3xWY4qdYricHRKz58zqqi5MZp","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5eb5f893a33c32b5b10b904cec858f10f7a12fee","amp;dn":"The+Chaplet+of+Divine+Mercy+in+Song+%28Catholic+Prayer%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5eb5f893a33c32b5b10b904cec858f10f7a12fee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,181,248,147,163,60,50,181,177,11,144,76,236,133,143,16,247,161,47,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
