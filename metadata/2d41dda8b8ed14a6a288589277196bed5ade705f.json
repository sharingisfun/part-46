Born in Kingston upon Thames, Muybridge did his most famous work in California, where his experiments in early cinema and the public projection of his images using a machine he invented astounded audiences worldwide. Alan Yentob follows in Muybridge's footsteps as he makes - and often changes - his name, and sets off to kill his young wife's lover.\n\nBBC Site\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wdlkz\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: Xvid\nVideo Bitrate: 1688 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.800:1\nVideo Resolution: 720x400\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 128 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 58 mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 746 MB\nSubtitles: English (available from MVGroup)\nSource: DVB-S (BBC HD)\n\nHere's the 720p HD:\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6019559\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d41dda8b8ed14a6a288589277196bed5ade705f","amp;dn":"BBC+Imagine+The+Weird+Adventures+of+Eadweard+Muybridge+HDTV+Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d41dda8b8ed14a6a288589277196bed5ade705f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,65,221,168,184,237,20,166,162,136,88,146,119,25,107,237,90,222,112,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
