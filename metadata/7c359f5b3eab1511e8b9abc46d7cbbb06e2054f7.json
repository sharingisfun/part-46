Hoover (pdf)\n\n\nThis book will expose the myths and falsehoods while revealing the truths about water quality and its relationship to health and longevity.\n\nThink of what you need to merely survive. Food? Water? Air? Cell phones? Obviously, by the book's title, I'm going to concentrate on water. Water is of major importance to all living things; in some organisms, up to 90% of their body weight comes from water. Up to 60-70% of the human body is water, the brain is composed of over 70-72% water, and the lungs nearly 90%. Lean muscle tissue contains about 75% water by weight, as is the brain; body fat contains 10-12% water and bone has 20-22% water. About 83% of our blood is water, which helps digest our food, transport waste, and control body temperature. Each day humans must replace 2.5 to 3 qts. of water lost through the excretory system, with most of it replaced through drinking, and the rest from our foods.\n\nSo it only stands to reason that the quality and quantity of water we replace daily has a direct bearing on our health and longevity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c359f5b3eab1511e8b9abc46d7cbbb06e2054f7","amp;dn":"Distilled+Water+and+Health+-+Douglas+C.+Hoover.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c359f5b3eab1511e8b9abc46d7cbbb06e2054f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,53,159,91,62,171,21,17,232,185,171,196,109,124,187,176,110,32,84,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
