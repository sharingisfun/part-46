Her quiet life is thrown into turmoil, however, when her prisoner-of-war husband, Donald, makes an outrageous demand for sexual gratification. He wants a dirty letter! Horrified, at first, that Donald is being turned into some sort of monster by the Nazis, ToryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disgust gradually gives way to a sense of marital duty, and taking in the libraries, bookshops, public conveniences and barbersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ shops of South-East London, she begins a quest to master the language of carnal desire: a quest that takes a sudden and unexpected turn into far more dangerous territory. Beginning with an act of unintentional cannibalism, and flirting with a scheme to end world hunger by the use of protein pills, Letters from an Unknown Woman ranges widely across the Continent and yet always returns home: to family, to people, to relationships. Woodward offers a prescient examination of the ways in which we both nurture and consume each other in the face of adversity","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c385a58960e4e51e6cda09026a18f3cceb30bc6e","amp;dn":"Letters+From+an+Unknown+Woman+by+Gerard+Woodward+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c385a58960e4e51e6cda09026a18f3cceb30bc6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,133,165,137,96,228,229,30,108,218,9,2,106,24,243,204,235,48,188,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
