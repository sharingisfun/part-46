The monthly magazine was launched in October 1980 by Time Inc. Discover was originally launched into a burgeoning market for science magazines aimed at educated non-professionals, intended to be somewhat easier to read than Scientific American but more detailed and science-oriented than magazines like Popular Science.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b30326852d1924a836ffcf0c36feaad45995b2d","amp;dn":"Discover+Magazine+-+June+2010+%28US%29+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b30326852d1924a836ffcf0c36feaad45995b2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,48,50,104,82,209,146,74,131,111,252,240,195,111,234,173,69,153,91,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
