My source files\r\nwere a hot mess of 11 low resolution video clips I found\r\nonline, and the first 10 of them had combing artifacts, \r\nwhich get much more visible in clips 7-10. They also had \r\na wrong aspect ratio except for the last clip.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions of the source files (after cropping\r\nthe black borders) were:\r\n\r\n580x326 (clips 1-6 - 0:00-33:27)\r\n320x180 (clips 7-10 - 33:27-62:15)\r\n320x240 (clip 11 - 62:15-73:19)\r\n\r\nWhy am I telling you this? Just to let you know what kind\r\nof quality to expect (crap quality). The audio, on the \r\nother hand, is quite tolerable. There are a few short\r\nglitches, and you can hear where the original video clips\r\nchange, because they had a few overlapping frames.\r\n\r\n**********************************************************\r\n\r\n3 Chains o' Gold is a 1994 direct-to-video film produced \r\nand directed by Prince and starring Prince and The New Power \r\nGeneration. It is a video collection, tied together with a \r\nloose plotline. The film was the 69th best-selling video of \r\n1994.\r\n\r\nThe film was accompanied by the Love Symbol album, however not \r\nall of the album's songs make an appearance in the film, and \r\nsome of the songs are edited versions. The film's title song is \r\nonly an instrumental at the end. However, some of the dialogue \r\nfrom the album does appear in the film (a phone call from a \r\nreporter, played by Kirstie Alley, to Prince). The final speech \r\nof the film (made by Mayte) does not appear on the album, \r\ninstead another phone call is in its place. The actual songs \r\nthat appear in the film are:\r\n\r\n&quot;My Name Is Prince&quot;\r\n&quot;Sexy MF&quot;\r\n&quot;Love 2 the 9s&quot;\r\n&quot;The Morning Papers&quot;\r\n&quot;The Max&quot;\r\n&quot;Blue Light&quot;\r\n&quot;I Wanna Melt with U&quot;\r\n&quot;Sweet Baby&quot;\r\n&quot;The Continental&quot;\r\n&quot;Damn U&quot;\r\n&quot;7&quot;\r\n&quot;The Call&quot;\r\n\r\n****************************************************************\r\n\r\nFILE INFO:\r\n\r\nContainer.......: mp4\r\nFile Size.......: 382 MB\r\nRun Time........: 01:13:19                 \r\nVideo Resolution: 480x360 (4:3)\r\nVideo Codec.....: x264 (Format Profile:   ) \r\nVideo Quality...: CRAP (Setting CRF:20,0)\r\nAudio...........: aac, 2.0 channels, 96 kbps\r\nAudio Language..: English\r\nFrame Rate......: 29,97 fps\r\nSource..........: See above\r\n\r\nScreenshots:\r\n \nhttps://someimage.com/s57szS1 \nhttps://someimage.com/zcCXqcY \nhttps://someimage.com/2actjbn \nhttps://someimage.com/aQAiv7A \nhttps://someimage.com/yI2x7yB \nhttps://someimage.com/XkVVAm4 \nhttps://someimage.com/uz3mNSw \nhttps://someimage.com/eKl7V8i","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e40d424c432f31a3c9a21dda94f8df07fc2d547","amp;dn":"Prince+-+3+Chains+O%27+Gold+%281994%29+%28WEBRIP%29+%5BMP4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e40d424c432f31a3c9a21dda94f8df07fc2d547","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,64,212,36,196,50,243,26,60,154,33,221,169,79,141,240,127,194,213,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
