You know what sympathy means, you also know what apathy means; but empathy you do not know.\r\n\r\nSympathy and apathy are opposed to each other. Empathy is beyond both. To help you understand it, let me tell you an incident in Ramakrishna's life.\r\n.........................\r\nQuestion 2:\r\n\r\nBELOVED MASTER,\r\n\r\nFOR CENTURIES THE BRITISH BOBBY, WITH NO GUN, ONLY A SMALL TRUNCHEON, HAS\r\nBEEN A SYMBOL OF THE RESPECT FOR LAW AND ORDER IN A CIVILIZED COUNTRY. NOW\r\nRIOTERS ARE ATTACKING THE POLICE WITH SHOTGUNS AND GAS BOMBS. IN THE LATEST\r\nRIOT TWO HUNDRED POLICEMEN WERE WOUNDED AND ONE KILLED WITH A HATCHET.

The ego is not you.\r\nQuestion 4:\r\n\r\nBELOVED MASTER,\r\n\r\nIS SYNCHRONICITY THE VERY LAW OF LIFE?\r\n\r\nIt is exactly the same as empathy. It is a scientific name for empathy - synchronicity. There is no difference between the two.\r\n\r\nQuestion 5:\r\n\r\nBELOVED MASTER,\r\n\r\nCAN YOU SORT OUT THE BIG PEAS, THE SMALL PEAS, AND THE MIDDLE PEAS?\r\n\r\nIt is a difficult problem.
