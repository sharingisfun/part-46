What did Jesus mean to say to us? What is his will for us today? Drawing on the Sermon on the Mount, Dietrich Bonhoeffer answers these timeless questions by providing a seminal reading of the dichotomy between 'cheap grace' and 'costly grace.' 'Cheap grace,' Bonhoeffer wrote, 'is the grace we bestow on ourselves...grace without discipleship....Costly grace is the gospel which must be sought again and again, the girl which must be asked for, the door at which a man must know....It is costly because it costs a man his life, and it is grace because it gives a man the only true life.'\n\nThe Cost of Discipleship is a compelling statement of the demands of sacrifice and ethical consistency from a man whose life and thought were exemplary articulations of a new type of leadership inspired by the Gospel, and imbued with the spirit of Christian humanism and a creative sense of civic duty.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df3d65270d683534c6ce4d2e6e72abafcc9f82ed","amp;dn":"Bonhoeffer+-+Cost+of+Discipleship","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df3d65270d683534c6ce4d2e6e72abafcc9f82ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,61,101,39,13,104,53,52,198,206,77,46,110,114,171,175,204,159,130,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
