Had it not    |\n|   been for this band, &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; may never have been          |\n|   recorded. Another college rock favorite, Bob Mould, made a deliberate      |\n|   Pixies rip off song with &quot;A Good Idea,&quot; off of his watershedding Copper    |\n|   Blue CD.                                                                   |\n|                                                                              |\n|   For as influential as the Pixies were, they never really had an album      |\n|   that fully realized their talents. They came close with Doolittle, but     |\n|   there wasn't a classic album in their collection, like Daydream Nation     |\n|   or New Day Rising.                                                         |\n|                                                                              |\n|   Thank god for &quot;greatest hits&quot; collections. Sure they can be cheap ways     |\n|   to pour a little more dough into a band's band accounts, but in the        |\n|   Pixies case, it's also the perfect starter for anyone who was facinated    |\n|   by the influence that the Pixies had on other bands, but were not old      |\n|   enough to catch the band live or hear them on college radio stations.      |\n|                                                                              |\n|   Death To The Pixies his you square in the face with the first song,        |\n|   &quot;Cecilia Ann.&quot; Between Joey Santiago's dynamic guitar skills and Black     |\n|   Francis' (formerly Charles Thompson, now Frank Black) backup guitar        |\n|   attack, it's fair to say that the Pixies were not content with remaining   |\n|   a cult band. Their sound was big, and they had the songs to make it        |\n|   big.                                                                       |\n|                                                                              |\n|   The furious assault of each of the musicians were matched by the stern     |\n|   sense of melody. As pulverizing as &quot;Planet Of Sound&quot; is, the bass line     |\n|   by Kim Deal throbs clear as a Beatles bass line. If there was a perfect    |\n|   &quot;Pixies&quot; song, it would have to be &quot;Wave Of Mutilation&quot;; in under three    |\n|   minutes, you get a towering guitar intro and a chorus that's practically   |\n|   impossible to shun off after the first listen.                             |\n|                                                                              |\n|   After the breathless &quot;Wave,&quot; a pretty spring-like song, &quot;Dig For Fire&quot;     |\n|   comes on. It's a nice contrast that shows the strong songwriting skills    |\n|   of the band. And it also marks a turning point in Death To The Pixies.     |\n|   From then on, the songs grow more experimental, to the point of where      |\n|   you can tell what songs were Kim Deal-influenced and what songs were all   |\n|   about Black Francis.                                                       |\n|                                                                              |\n|   That's not to say that the earlier songs had their creative warzones.      |\n|   Thankfully, Death To The Pixies does not follow a strict chronological     |\n|   order. The second has many of the songs on the first disc, but instead     |\n|   the live versions of the songs are performed. The live versions of some    |\n|   of the songs are radically different than the studio recordings, not so    |\n|   much as the sound quality, but the tangents the band hit when they were    |\n|   playing these songs took them on different roads.                          |\n|                                                                              |\n|   With such a talented lineup, it was inevitable that each member wanted     |\n|   to go their seperate directions. Unfortunately, each of the artists made   |\n|   that one great solo album or solo project album and then either faded      |\n|   into obscurity (Breeders anyone?) or were in bands that basically let      |\n|   the musician have their own say(Frank Black). And as history shows, it's   |\n|   usually nice to have a Keith Richards or John Lennon to keep the Mick      |\n|   Jagger and Paul McCartney's of the world in check and vice versa.          |\n|                                                                              |\n|   For anyone who is interested in how college rock evolved into what is      |\n|   was in the early '90s, there is no closer necessity than Death To The      |\n|   Pixies to purchase. Find out what songs you like the best and pick up      |\n|   the album that has most of those songs on them. Be cautioned however,      |\n|   you'll never look at Nirvana in the same light again.
