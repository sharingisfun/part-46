He was one of the earliest innovators of the then-new literary art form called jazz poetry. Hughes is best known as a leader of the Harlem Renaissance. He famously wrote about the period that &quot;the negro was in vogue&quot;, which was later paraphrased as &quot;when Harlem was in vogue&quot;.\n\nFirst published in The Crisis in 1921, &quot;The Negro Speaks of Rivers&quot;, which became Hughes's signature poem, was collected in his first book of poetry The Weary Blues (1926). Hughes and his contemporaries had different goals and aspirations than the black middle class. They criticized the men known as the midwives of the Harlem Renaissance: W. E. B. Du Bois, Jessie Redmon Fauset, and Alain LeRoy Locke, as being overly accommodating and assimilating eurocentric values and culture to achieve social equality.\n\nHis poetry and fiction portrayed the lives of the working-class blacks in America, lives he portrayed as full of struggle, joy, laughter, and music. Permeating his work is pride in the African-American identity and its diverse culture. &quot;My seeking has been to explain and illuminate the Negro condition in America and obliquely that of all human kind,&quot; Hughes is quoted as saying. He confronted racial stereotypes, protested social conditions, and expanded African AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s image of itself; a &quot;people's poet&quot; who sought to reeducate both audience and artist by lifting the theory of the black aesthetic into reality.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following books, and all are in ePUB format:\n\n* Selected Poems of Langston Hughes\n\n* Tambourines to Glory\n\n* The Panther and the Lash - Poems of Our Times\n\n* The Ways of White Folks - Stories\n \n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langston_Hughes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langston_Hughes&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/langston_hughes/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/langston_hughes/index.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c7f822917bc6e8e759b410a0711cf24f77aec8b","amp;dn":"Langston+Hughes+-+Poetry+%26amp%3B+Prose+%284+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c7f822917bc6e8e759b410a0711cf24f77aec8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,127,130,41,23,188,110,142,117,155,65,10,7,17,207,36,247,122,236,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
