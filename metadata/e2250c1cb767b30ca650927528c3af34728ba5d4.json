See what else popped for us in 2011.\n\nSelection Criteria:\n\n1. The 2011 best-of lists were voted on by the Amazon music team, which includes not only the editors, but everyone else behind the scenes, too. It was a very democratic process. These are strictly our favorite albums; sales information did not factor into our choices at all.\n\n2. Customer favorites are ranked according to customer orders through November. Only songs and albums made commercially available in the United States for the first time 2011 are eligible (with the obvious exception of our reissues and rediscoveries list).\n\n3. Likewise, titles included in best-of lists must have been available for listening by Amazon music team members by November 24, which, we know, will inevitably exclude some notable titles. All due apologies to folks such as Black Keys, Amy Winehouse, the Roots, and others who had late releases we would've liked to have gotten to know before our voting deadline.\n\nCollection Link:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;plgroup=2&amp;docId=1000757171&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;plgroup=2&amp;docId=1000757171&lt;/a&gt;\n\n------------\n\nSelected Albums:\n\n01.
