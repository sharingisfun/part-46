Put track fades on the beginning and ending, but you can break the CDs however you want to. \n\n***DO NOT DISTRIBUTE IN LOSSY FORMATS***\n\n\n01 Intro\n02 Seek Up\n03 Proudest Monkey\n04 Satellite\n05 Pantala Naga Pampa &gt; Rapunzel\n06 Louisiana Bayou\n07 Out Of My Hands\n08 Fuzzy Wuzzy (Improv)\n09 Sledgehammer\n10 Lover Lay Down\n11 Rhyme And Reason\n12 Jimi Thing\n13 Where Are You Going\n14 Money\n15 Warehouse\n16 Stay (Wasting Time)\n17 Encore Break\n18 Anyone Seen The Bridge\n19 Too Much\n20 All Along The Watchtower\n\nPretty good sounding feed. Pretty evenly balanced with a good amount of horns (although I know its not the Sax/Trumpet mix). Good amount of backing vocals. I&amp;#039;m not a huge DMB fan so I can&amp;#039;t really pass too much judgment. Vocals get kinda low on &amp;#039;Out of my Hands&amp;#039; if I recall correctly.\n\nSpecial thanks to Alex Coluzzi for all the help and education concerning how to record the DMB with wireless devices - you really are the king of the airwaves!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9d28a80d04040c53852f6c588e0acc015ccd3d1","amp;dn":"dmb2008.9.6-IEM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9d28a80d04040c53852f6c588e0acc015ccd3d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,210,138,128,208,64,64,197,56,82,246,197,136,224,172,192,21,204,211,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
