It's kind of hard to pigeonhole this band, which is refreshing -- part dewy-eyed psychedelic sentimentality (&quot;If you feel it, let it show!,&quot; singer Ed Ackerson implores on &quot;Avenue E&quot;), part punky bombast (&quot;Counting Down&quot; features the world's harshest guitar sound) and part gimmicky overkill (check out the voice treatment on &quot;One Foot&quot;), this album has all the offbeat charm of a goofy kid nephew. How do they manage to get such a consistently horrific guitar sound on &quot;Counting Down&quot; and yet make the song itself so pleasant? And how do they deliver those whimsical lyrics without ever sounding hippy-dippy? Polara's home base of Minneapolis has a history of producing weird but lovable bands and personalities (Husker Du, the Replacements, Prince), so this is just one more example of the fact that breeding shows.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0506e1aedea53a4da295c2aaafe0e5432ab4a172","amp;dn":"Polara+-+Polara+%281995%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0506e1aedea53a4da295c2aaafe0e5432ab4a172","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,6,225,174,222,165,58,77,162,149,194,170,175,224,229,67,42,180,161,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
