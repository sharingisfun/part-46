No design is too ambitious, and no obstacle too large in their quest for the perfect house.\r\nFollowing the internationally successful Grand Designs format, the series will see the process of these incredible design projects, as well as the personal journeys of those building them - from the initial blueprints, through to the long and often arduous task of turning the plans into practical living spaces.\r\nUsing archaic or new-school building techniques and material, and locations from the beach, to the mountains, and the hills in between, Grand Designs New Zealand will feature houses ranging from architectural designer mansions to DIY homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6)  Clifftop House \r\nSurfing Pastor Hamish Divett and his psychologist wife Diane have lived by the ocean for years, but in a dark, south-facing house that failed to take full advantage of the beautiful vista. To get the view they desperately desire, the couple have decided to push structural and logical planning to the limits. By building on a crumbling cliff with a sheer drop to the sea below, the Divetts will push their team to the edge to see this Grand Design though to completion.\r\n\r\n7)  Straw Bale House \r\nBetween them, Mike and Cathy have seven children from their previous marriages. With the last child finally moved out of home, the couple are going to build a Grand Design in which they will live alone together for the first time. They will be calling on Catherine's skills as one of the few female joiners in the country and Mike's talents as an inventor to build a unique straw bale and hemp house on an exposed rocky outcrop near Wanaka.\r\n\r\n8)  American Barns \r\nTimber merchant Marty Verry and his Venezuelan wife Morella have imported two historic New York barn frames that could be considered the oldest buildings in New Zealand. With plans to assemble the barn on the couples' rural site on the outskirts of Auckland, they intend them to become part of a modernist mansion acting as a tribute to the different timber Marty loves. But will the new homes honour the history they are built on or is this Grand Design set to take on a life of its own?\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a7/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8b/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2c/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9f/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ac/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/de/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/13/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/33/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e2/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/be/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fc/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/79/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1e/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/09/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c0/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/02/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3164 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 45mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 8\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1,017 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.tv3.co.nz/Shows/GrandDesignsNZ.aspx","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec67faada5d2aac398bb8f13a45dd89d83ba499c","amp;dn":"Grand+Designs+New+Zealand+Series+1+6of8+Clifftop+House+720p+x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec67faada5d2aac398bb8f13a45dd89d83ba499c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,103,250,173,165,210,170,195,152,187,143,19,164,93,216,157,131,186,73,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
