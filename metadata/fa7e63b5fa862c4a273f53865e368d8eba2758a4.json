The sbd's posted are incomplete and I personally really think this is a much meatier recording.  U B the judge.  A really good show from a great tour! The boyz were laid back, to say the least. The Orange Blossom was in memory of Chubby who passed just prior to the shows.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa7e63b5fa862c4a273f53865e368d8eba2758a4","amp;dn":"Widespread+Panic+-+1996-02-11+-+Sheraton+Ballroom+in+Steamboat+S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa7e63b5fa862c4a273f53865e368d8eba2758a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,126,99,181,250,134,44,74,39,63,83,134,94,54,141,142,186,39,88,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
