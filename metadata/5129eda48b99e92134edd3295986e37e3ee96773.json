It reached number one in the British music charts. It was completely different from their previous hits, as it was funk.\n\nPrecious lyrics:\n\nYour precious love - that means so much\nwill it ever stop or will I just lose touch\nWhat I want to say - but my words just fail\nIs that I need it so I can&amp;#039;t help myself\nLike a hungry child - I just help myself\nAnd when I&amp;#039;m all full up - I go out to play\n\nBut I don&amp;#039;t mean to bleed you dry\nOr take you over for the rest of your life\nIt&amp;#039;s just that I need something solid in mine\n\nLonely as the moors on a winter&amp;#039;s morning\nQuiet as the sea on a good calm night\nIn your tranquil shadow - I try and follow\n\nI hear your distant show clicks\nTo the midnight beat -\nI feel trapped in sorrow\nIn this imagery\nBut that&amp;#039;s how I am and why I need you so","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5129eda48b99e92134edd3295986e37e3ee96773","amp;dn":"The+Jam+-+Precious","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5129eda48b99e92134edd3295986e37e3ee96773","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,41,237,164,139,153,233,33,52,237,211,41,89,134,227,126,62,233,103,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
