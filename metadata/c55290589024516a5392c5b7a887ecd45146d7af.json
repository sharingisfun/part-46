A 40- minute class, focus is on balance poses and the hamstrings as well as cardio and stress relief.\n\nRelease &quot;old narratives and stories&quot; from your hamstrings and cultivate the space needed to avoid holding tension in the area. Hamstring tension is also associated with holding onto a time when we had to protect ourselves.\n\nEnergize your body and heal or prevent injuries in the hamstrings, as this part of the body is a frequent &quot;sore spot&quot; for yogis. Because tightness in the hamstrings hampers other physical activities, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s essential to work on it so you may enjoy your practice and simply feel better!\n\nA flexible body begins with a flexible mind, which is why Lauren has you take a few moments to &quot;shift the gaze inside.&quot; Turn inward, focus on the breath, and work those hamstrings!\n\nLevel: Intermediate\nStyle: Power, Vinyasa\nFocus: Hamstrings, Stress Relief, Balance Poses, Cardio\n\nVideo; x264; 1280*720 (16:9); 1818 kbps; 23.976 fps\nAudio; aac; 160 kbps; 2 ch; 48.0 Khz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c55290589024516a5392c5b7a887ecd45146d7af","amp;dn":"Lauren+Eckstrom+Yoga+-+Out+with+the+Old+40+min+x264+aac+%5BMP4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c55290589024516a5392c5b7a887ecd45146d7af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,82,144,88,144,36,81,106,83,146,197,183,168,135,236,212,81,70,215,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
