Leo studies her movements and ends up kidnapping her, as if she was his object to add to his erotic collection.\n\nThe films of legendary Spanish director Bigas Luna literally overflow with symbolist and surrealist images, drawn from his seemingly inexhaustible passion for sex, food and his native Catalunya. Everything is oversized in LunaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s universe, from womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s breasts to male egos; one of his great gifts as a filmmaker is to be able to satirize Spanish culture without deflating any of its mysteries. Born in Barcelona in 1946, Luna studied painting and design in college, and founded his own avant garde design company soon after graduation. BILBAO (1978), his second film, brought him international attention. The disturbing first-person narrative of an emotionally-crippled voyeur, BILBAO also reverberated with political implications: the title refers to both a prostituteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s name and the industrial capital of the Basque region, long a center of resistance to Castilian control. Bigas LunaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most scandalous and controversial film has only been shown a handful of times in the U.S. where it was greeted with outrage by shocked audiences. \n\nFile Name .........................................: Bilbao.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,545,508,864 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:33:46\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 672x504 (AR: 1.333)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1740 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.205 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 448 kb/s [6 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077236/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077236/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: Spanish\nSubtitles: English and Portuguese\n\nMy rip\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07ea53551ee650e3bef7d620efe243cbda952c34","amp;dn":"Bigas+Luna+-+Bilbao+%281978%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07ea53551ee650e3bef7d620efe243cbda952c34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,234,83,85,30,230,80,227,190,247,214,32,239,226,67,203,218,149,44,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
