Murray shines on all tracks, switching between tenor and bass clarinet. The octet featuring pianist D.D. Jackson, trombonist Craig Harris, trumpeters Ravi Best and Rasul Siddik, alto saxophonist and flutist James Spaulding, bassist Jaribu Shahid, and drummer Mark Johnson sound like twice the number of musicians throughout this disc.\n\nTracks:\n1 Giant Steps\n2 Naima\n3 The Crossing\n4 India\n5 Lazy Bird\n6 A Love Supreme, Pt. 1: Acknowledgement\n\nFormat: Musepack (&quot;extreme&quot;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52f671a36583a342e2a1ba925f0cf38c6634e83e","amp;dn":"David+Murray+Octet+-+Octet+Plays+Trane","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52f671a36583a342e2a1ba925f0cf38c6634e83e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,246,113,163,101,131,163,66,226,161,186,146,95,12,243,140,102,52,232,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
