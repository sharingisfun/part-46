He takes delivery of a 1970 Dodge Challenger to take from Colorado to San Fransisco, California. Shortly after pickup, he takes a bet to get the car there in less than 15 hours. After a few run-ins with motorcycle cops and highway patrol they start a chase to bring him into custody. Along the way, Kowalski is guided by Supersoul - a blind DJ with a police radio scanner. Throw in lots of chase scenes, gay hitchhikers, a naked woman riding a motorbike, lots of Mopar and you've got a great cult hit from the early 70's. \n\n\n&quot;XVID&quot; (XviD Mpeg-4 Video)\n624x338, 23.976025 fps\nHigh Qaulity 2-Pass\n\n192 kbps (MPEG-1 Layer-3 Audio (mp3))\n2 channels, 48000Hz\nLanguage: English\n\n\nEnjoy....\n\n\nBest car chase movie known to man....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af189245818452ee02650a503c39ee6ed94e82be","amp;dn":"Vanishing.Point.DVDRip.Xvid.1971-tots","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af189245818452ee02650a503c39ee6ed94e82be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,24,146,69,129,132,82,238,2,101,10,80,60,57,238,110,217,78,130,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
