Released after \ntorturous process that included getting bounced by a major label&amp;#039;s Nashville\ndivision because said debut single was lost in a corporate downsizing and the\naftermath of the 9/11 attacks, plus an earlier version of the album that was\nreleased on Koch Entertainment&amp;#039;s country imprint Aspirion as Robin English in\n2006 with different cover art, some different mixes, and a couple of minor so\n(&quot;Hello Me&quot; and &quot;I&amp;#039;m Yours&quot;) that were left off this version. So finally, goi\nthe self-release and indie distribution route, Robin English finally has her\ndebut album out. And it&amp;#039;s...OK. English, who co-produced the album and wrote \nco-wrote every song, is a pretty decent country songwriter with an eye for\ntextural detail; &quot;Baby You&amp;#039;re the Man&quot; and several other songs make direct\nreference to her east Texas roots in a fashion sure to please other Lone Star\nstaters. She also has a better than average voice, with a particularly\nimpressive low register, as she shows on the bluesy gospel tune &quot;Mission of\nMercy&quot; and the sultry purr of &quot;Wake Up Loving You.&quot; But those appealing eleme\nare set against some fairly average tunes given a generally disinterested\nNashville-style radio-ready gloss that tends to overpower the more unique,\npersonal traits of English&amp;#039;s lyrics and vocals. Put in a more stripped-down,\nlive sounding setting (maybe even an actual live album!), Robin English and h\nsongs would come across much better than they do here. Perhaps having finally\ngotten this project completed to her liking, she can move forward from here.\n\n\n01 Cotton Field Girl                           \n02 Enjoy The Ride                              \n03 Mission Of Mercy                            \n04 The Least I Can Do                          \n05 Mama&amp;#039;s Don&amp;#039;t Let Your Cowboys Grow Up To Be \n   Babies\n06 Wake Up Loving You                          \n07 Yellow Rose In Me                           \n08 Baby, You&amp;#039;re The Man                        \n09 I&amp;#039;m The One                                 \n10 Lion And The Lamb                           \n11 Cotton Field Girl (Radio Edit)  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59c1359935411ea48a5f1c38d3ecf2ca2c496f92","amp;dn":"Robin+English-Velvet+Covered+Brick","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59c1359935411ea48a5f1c38d3ecf2ca2c496f92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,193,53,153,53,65,30,164,138,95,28,56,211,236,242,202,44,73,111,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
