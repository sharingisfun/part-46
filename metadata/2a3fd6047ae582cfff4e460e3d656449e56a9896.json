Released in 1976, it has the strongest opening side of any record in Walker&amp;#039;s career. It includes a stomping cover of Tom Waits&amp;#039; &quot;Lookin&amp;#039; for the Heart of Saturday Night,&quot; reinvented as a rock roll song with B3s and Fender Rhodes pianos underneath a throbbing bass line (and replaces Waits&amp;#039; own version as definitive), and an urbanized honky tonk read of Butch Hancock&amp;#039;s &quot;Standin&amp;#039; at the Big Hotel&quot; that blows away Joe Ely&amp;#039;s and sounds a lot more like L.A. than Dallas -- which was the original intent of the song -- just to name two. In addition, Walker rounds out side one with the Gary P. Nunn/Karen Brooks classic &quot;Couldn&amp;#039;t Do Nothin&amp;#039; Right,&quot; a ballad of resignation and brokenness at leaving a lover who always expected more than there was to give; it also features Lee Clayton&amp;#039;s greatest love song, &quot;Won&amp;#039;t You Give Me One More Chance,&quot; Bob Livingstone&amp;#039;s &quot;Head Full of Nothin&amp;#039;,&quot; and a stirring, good-timey take on Billy Joe Shaver&amp;#039;s classic &quot;Old Five and Dimers Like Me.&quot; What is most notable here is what a great interpreter Walker is on other writers&amp;#039; songs, rather than as a songwriter making them his own in the process. There is only one original on the set, and that&amp;#039;s the immortal &quot;Stoney,&quot; which proves Walker hadn&amp;#039;t lost it, but was going for something else entirely. There are a couple of Keith Sykes&amp;#039; tunes on side two, including &quot;Someday I&amp;#039;ll Get out of These Bars&quot; (which Walker hasn&amp;#039;t yet, over 27 years later), Billy C. Farlow&amp;#039;s &quot;Leroy,&quot; and Bob Livingstone&amp;#039;s title track, all of which prove, like the first side, that this was indeed an album for singing, not writing, and as such, it stands as one of Walker&amp;#039;s water marks; it endures far better than some of his other material from the same period.\n\n- Thom Jurek, All Music Guide\n\n1976 It&amp;#039;s A Good Night For Singin&amp;#039; (Out of print)\n\nLP, MCA - MCA2022\n\n   1.
