It discusses each thinkerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s key contributions, the way this contribution was expressed in practice and the relationship between their life and ideas. This discussion is supported by an extract from the thinkerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own writing, to give a flavour of their work and to give readers a sense of which thinkers are most relevant to their own interests.\n\nSystems thinking is necessarily interdisciplinary, so that the thinkers selected come from a wide range of areas ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ biology, management, physiology, anthropology, chemistry, public policy, sociology and environmental studies among others. A significant aim of the book is to broaden and deepen the readerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s interest in systems writers, providing an appetising ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“tasterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ for each of the 30 thinkers, so that the reader is encouraged to go on to study the published works of the thinkers themselves.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8761802c2f5d538720baf22b2fef06aa70a7c8b","amp;dn":"Systems+Thinkers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8761802c2f5d538720baf22b2fef06aa70a7c8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,118,24,2,194,245,213,56,114,11,175,34,178,254,240,106,167,10,124,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
