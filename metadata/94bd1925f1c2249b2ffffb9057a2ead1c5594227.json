Some Of You Folks\n\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s taken seven studio albums and a trip to Nashville, but Luke Doucet has finally crossed over completely into classic rock territory. That's not a value judgement, mind you. There have been traces of classicism throughout Doucet's career, mostly stemming from his belief that musicianship isn't a four-letter word, and that desire to align with Can-rockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past has always been a part of his appeal. It's just never been as prominent as it is on Steel City Trawler.\n\nThe most obvious example is a cover of Gordon Lightfoot's Ã¢â‚¬Å“SundownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that might best the original, but it doesn't end there. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dirty, Dirty BlondeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has a cocky strut that wouldn't sound too out of place sandwiched between Ã¢â‚¬Å“Brown SugarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“La GrangeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on classic rock radio. Ã¢â‚¬Å“You Gotta Get ItÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ falls somewhere closer to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Down By the River,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ only poppier. They work, though, partly because Doucet puts a concerted effort into perfecting his melodies and partly because his eye for seemingly mundane details remains intact Ã¢â‚¬â€ listen to the heartbreaking Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Ballad of Ian CurtisÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for proof. But whether he's wallowing in finger-picked balladry or stomping through a solo-heavy rocker, it never feels put on Ã¢â‚¬â€ and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why this works. Steel City may sound like it's trawling through your dad's record collection, but that just means it feels like home.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94bd1925f1c2249b2ffffb9057a2ead1c5594227","amp;dn":"Luke+Doucet+And+The+White+Falcon+-+Steel+City+Trawler+%5B2010%5D+%5BFL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94bd1925f1c2249b2ffffb9057a2ead1c5594227","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,189,25,37,241,194,36,155,47,255,251,144,87,162,234,209,197,89,66,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
