See the anchor stones which hung from the ark.\n\n The Red Sea Crossing with the 3,000 year old ancient column marking the location. See chariot parts and people parts on the sea floor at Nuweiba, Egypt.\n\n Mt. Sinai in Saudi Arabia with its blackened and burned peak. See the large stone altar that hosted the golden calf. Visit the split rock where water flowed out for the children of Israel.\n\n Hear about the Ark of the Covenant hidden in a cave at Jerusalem near Golgotha, the Place of the Skull, and the incredible evidence that rests on the Mercy Seat.\n\n Bonus Material - Ron Wyatt Presentations: All the discoveries were found by the late Ron Wyatt who worked on the sites for 22 years, while making over 120 trips overseas to accomplish this work with the Lord. A series of miracles took place while Mr. Wyatt made the discoveries. He explains the significance of the discoveries and tells of some interesting experiences.\n\n\n Also includes the following videos:\n Archaeologists Proves God Exist:\n Archaeologist Jonathan Gray detemine the authenticity of Ron Wyatt's discoveries and video footage. In this indepth study, Dr Gray examines the facts that others over time have been discouraged to believe and provides a first hand account of the discoveries in his search for truth.\n\n Forbbiden Pictures Revealed - Did Ron Wyatt tell the truth?\n David Gates interviews Dr. David Kim, who made 12 trips behind military fences in Saudi Arabia and climbed Mt. Sinai to collect evidence of a Red Sea crossing. Amazing photos and artifacts that rconfirm Ron Wyatt's initial discoveries.\n\n A Korean physician, Dr. Kim was the personal physician for the Prince of Saudi Arabia for 16 years. During this time Dr. Kim made his repeated trips down into Midian to search for traces of the Exodus and Mount Sinai which he had heard about from materials published by Ron Wyatt.\n\n Because he was fluent in Arabic and had a personal recommendation from the Prince, with the help of local Bedoins, Dr. Kim was able to get behind the fences protected by the military. He climbed Mt. Sinai and discovered many Hebrew petroglyphs previously unknown by the public. He took thousands of pictures and collected artifacts.\n\n Here is his outstanding testimony and photographs which confirm the location of the Red Sea crossing during the Exodus. His research is an important part of the new documentary to be released called &quot;The Exodus Conspiracy&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n This is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\n Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\n The Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\n In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n &quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n &quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal.
