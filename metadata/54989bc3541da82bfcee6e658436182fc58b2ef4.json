Demons are the disembodied Spirits of The Nephilim. They want to enter your Body, but they must have your permission.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSatanology and demonology (subcategories of Angelology) are the two branches of systematic theology that investigate, classify, and categorize the biblical teaching in relation to Satan and his followers, the fallen angels. This aspect of theology has been frequently overlooked or distorted to the detriment of the modern church. In the nineteenth and much of the twentieth centuries, this neglect was a consequence of the undue influence of antiÃ¢â‚¬â€˜supernatural rationalism on theology.  Under this subtle pressure, aspects of the supernatural were either downplayed or ignored, especially when the existence of a personal devil or demons was the subject. By the late twentieth century, the bankruptcy of rationalist modernism led to its replacement by postmodernism in Western culture as a whole. Accompanying this postmodern shift is a renewed interest in the soÃ¢â‚¬â€˜called Ã¢â‚¬Å“spiritualÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, but this new spirituality is frequently divorced from a JudeoÃ¢â‚¬â€˜Christian heritage or biblical base.\n\n\nIn the course of this study, we will first examine the personality of Satan, his creation and fall, and then investigate his role in human history, his power, strategy, and limitations.  Subsequently, we will analyze the biblical teaching on the demons, their origin, fall, role, and ultimate destiny.  At the conclusion, we will pay close attention to the nature of spiritual warfare and to the believerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s protection against the demonic.\n\nAngelology\n\nA key verse on angelology is Hebrews 1:14, &quot;Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?&quot;\n\nAngelology gives us God's perspective on angels. Angels are personal beings who worship and obey God. God sometimes sends angels to &quot;interfere&quot; in the course of humanity. Angelology helps us to recognize the warfare that exists between God's angels and Satan and his demons. A proper understanding of angelology is very important. When we understand that angels are created beings, just as we are, we realize that worshipping or praying to angels robs God of the glory that belongs to Him alone. It was God, not angels, who sent His Son to die for us, who loves and cares for us, and who alone is worthy of our adoration.\n\nDemonology\nIn ancient Babylon, demonology had an influence on even the most mundane elements of life, from petty annoyances to the emotions of love and hatred. The numerous demonic spirits were given charge over various parts of the human body, one for the head, one for the neck, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\nMore Torrents in this series at http://conspiracyhub.com/membershares.php?it=41 ALL TORRENTS are RELEASED here FIRST!!!
