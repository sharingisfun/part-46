It was released on the album Working Class Dog. The song is about unrequited love, and centers around a young man in love with his best friend&amp;#039;s girlfriend.\n\nUpon its release in 1981 the song became an instant hit, reaching #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks, and later won Springfield a Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance. The song was at #1 when MTV launched on August 1, 1981.\n\nSpringfield was taking a stained glass class along with his friend Gary and Gary&amp;#039;s girlfriend. He initially wanted to use the actual name of the friend he was singing about, but instead decided to go with a different name ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;Jessie&quot;. He happened to see a girl in a softball jersey with the name &quot;Jessie&quot; on it and changed the name from Gary to Jessie, then recorded the song. Springfield says that he does not remember the name of the girlfriend, and believes that the real woman who inspired the song has no idea that she was &quot;Jessie&amp;#039;s Girl&quot;, telling Oprah Winfrey, &quot;I was never really introduced to her. It was always just, like, panting from afar.&quot;\n\nThis song was featured in the 1997 film Boogie Nights. It was also featured in the 2004 film 13 Going on 30. Jessie&amp;#039;s Girl remains a staple of &quot;retro&quot; FM radio stations, and has gained further popularity on the back of the recent &quot;eighties revival&quot; trend.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd87c0b50690180593a7eed9f24cd571190d0bb3","amp;dn":"Rick+Springfield+-+Jessie%5C%27s+Girl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd87c0b50690180593a7eed9f24cd571190d0bb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,135,192,181,6,144,24,5,147,167,238,217,242,76,213,113,25,13,11,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
