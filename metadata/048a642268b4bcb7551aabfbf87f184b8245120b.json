Highest Quality. Dose converted from .drg to .wav &amp; saved in Apple Lossless format. Read or play from iTunes convert to your favorite format from there. Keep your bitrate up!\n\nIf you prefer another format let me know. (FLAC is BS, IMO)\n\nI'll do one at a time and keep the quality up. Coming from Mac. No virus.\n\n\n\nDXM\nPrescription (VERY Strong)\n45 Minutes\n\nDextromethorphan is a semisynthetic narcotic which is legally available over-the-counter in the United States. It is most commonly found in cough suppressants, especially those with &quot;DM&quot; or &quot;Tuss&quot; in their names. Our DXM dose comes very close to achieving the effects of the real thing: mood lift, euphoria, giggling, laughing, dissociation of mind from body, creative dreamlike experiences, and some users report empathic feelings, forgiveness, and warm feelings towards others. Some have even go as far to say that our dose is better than the real thing!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:048a642268b4bcb7551aabfbf87f184b8245120b","amp;dn":"I-Doser+-+DXM+-+Apple+Lossless","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"048a642268b4bcb7551aabfbf87f184b8245120b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,138,100,34,104,180,188,183,85,26,171,251,248,127,24,75,130,69,18,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
