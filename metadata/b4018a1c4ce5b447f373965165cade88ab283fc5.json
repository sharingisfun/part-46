To set Twenty 4 Seven apart from other similar groups, van Rijen decided to hire female singer Nancy Coolen. The combination of traditional rapping with female choruses proved to be a success, with their first single, &quot;I Can't Stand It!&quot; reaching #7 in the UK Singles Chart in 1990.[1] The next single, &quot;Are You Dreaming&quot;, did similarly well, reaching #17 in the United Kingdom.[1] In mid-1990, Street Moves, the project's debut album, was released.\n\nBy 1990, rappers MC Fixx it and Hanks &amp; Janks had stopped contributing to the group altogether, and by 1991, Dawson-Harrison left the group after a dispute with van Rijen to front Captain Hollywood Project, his already successful solo project. After Dawson-Harrison's departure, Twenty 4 Seven remained dormant for several years.\n\n\nIn 1993, Twenty 4 Seven returned with &quot;Slave to the Music&quot;, which charted impressively throughout Europe. The band quickly followed with &quot;Is It Love&quot;, &quot;Leave Them Alone&quot;, and &quot;Take Me Away&quot;, the latter charting at #5 in Israel. In late 1993, Is It Love, a full length studio album, was released worldwide, and was accompanied by a worldwide tour with stops in Europe, Australia, and Africa.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4018a1c4ce5b447f373965165cade88ab283fc5","amp;dn":"Twenty+4+Seven+-+Slave+To+The+Music+%28Album%29+320+kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4018a1c4ce5b447f373965165cade88ab283fc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,1,138,28,76,229,180,71,243,115,150,81,101,202,222,136,171,40,63,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
