In Lando , Louis L'Amour has created an unforgettable\nportrait of a unique hero.\n\nA man never to count out....\n\nFor six long years Orlando Sackett survived the horrors of a brutal\nMexican prison. He survived by using his skills as a boxer and by\nmaking three vows.\n\nThe first was to exact revenge on the hired killers who framed him.\nThe second was to return to his father. And the third was to find\nGin Locklear.\n\nBut the world has changed a lot since Lando left it. His father is\nmissing. The woman he loves is married. And the killers want him\ndead. Hardened physically and emotionally, Lando must begin an epic\njourney to resolve his past, even if it costs him his life.\n\n----\n\nLouis L'Amour is undoubtedly the bestselling frontier novelist of\nall time. He is the only American-born author in history to receive\nboth the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the Congressional Gold\nMedal in honor of his life's work. He has published ninety novels;\ntwenty-seven short-story collections; two works of nonfiction; a\nmemoir, Education of a Wandering Man; and a volume of poetry, Smoke\nfrom This Altar. There are more than 300 million copies of his\nbooks in print worldwide.\n\n----\n\nRead by Josh Hamilton\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:285e59da4bb20521e75f9327fa547a40e5c2fd6e","amp;dn":"Louis+L%5C%27Amour+-+Lando","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"285e59da4bb20521e75f9327fa547a40e5c2fd6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,94,89,218,75,178,5,33,231,95,147,39,250,84,122,64,229,194,253,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
