I prefer to think it was just ahead of\nits time, and if made today would be more successful.\n\nI searched in vain for this show on the internet for years, finding only a few\nepisodes originally captured with the primitive VCRs of the day.  (Typing\n&quot;Search&quot; into a search engine is a little like trying to throw out a garbage\ncan--the guys refuse to take it!)\n\nFinally at long long last the episodes were released to DVD in 2014, re-created\nfrom the original film negatives.  I present them here for other fans of this\ncool old high-tech adventure.\n\nThe original pilot movie was called Probe, (as the series was intended to be,\nbut that name was taken by an investigative news show on another network), and\nis included also from another source.  It is a poorer, yet watchable, quality.\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a015cfff9e6cb862fee6860c5e2ca5938944b625","amp;dn":"Search+TV+show+%281972-1973%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a015cfff9e6cb862fee6860c5e2ca5938944b625","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,21,207,255,158,108,184,98,254,230,134,12,94,44,165,147,137,68,182,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
