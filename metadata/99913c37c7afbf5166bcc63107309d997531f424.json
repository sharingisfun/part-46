Because this isn't any old Sonny &amp; Brownie reprint, it's the glorious Folkways recordings! \nOn this 2CD set you get the full tracks of four Folkways 10&quot; LPs plus eight bonus cuts taken from various parts of their career. Choice stuff indeed and rare too. If you were to bid for the four albums included, you'd need around Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£400 to win them. \nCD 1 contains the 1952 album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Get On Board',  the seven cuts from the 1956 Folkways album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Washboard Band-Country Dance Music' - a kind of a Almanac Singers gung-ho session supervised by the ubiquitous and as-always-over-enthusiastic Pete Seeger plus four blues from the 1940s. \nOn CD 2 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Brownie McGhee's Blues' (Folkways 2030) from 1955 sits alongside the historic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Sonny Terry's Washboard Band' (Folkways 2006) which supposedly features Sonny playing all the instruments. But the notes on my 10&quot; LP copy clearly states (in 59 year old pen and ink admittedly) that it's Alex Seward on washtub bass and JC Burris on bones! Then you get a further 5 tracks including a raucous Blind Boy Fuller's ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Custard Pie Blues' and a buoyant harp instrumental ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Lonesome Train' - a rampant boisterous workout ringing with Sonny's expressive harp and plenty of his trademark whoops and hollers. This music was recorded at a time when Sonny &amp; Brownie were wowing the New York music crowd with their authentic traditionally based material. \n\n\nTracklist\n\nDisc 1\nGET ON BOARD\n\n1.
