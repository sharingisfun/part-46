After grossly underestimating the quote and the job, the contractor abandoned them, living for over seven months in the dank, dirty basement of this dangerous and poorly supported skeleton of their former home. With Christmas just around the corner, and with all their money and hope drained, they ask Mike to take on the monumental task of giving this horror story a happy ending. Watch as Mike Holmes and his ever growing team of dedicated pros take on the biggest challenge of their lives, and in just eight weeks transform four thousand square feet of cold rafters and dust into an finished awe-inspiring dream home, just in time for the holidays!  \n\n\n\nDimensions: 720x480\nCodecs: MPEG-2 Video, AC3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d11ad11591e547464846b8f1b0aefcc9809053f","amp;dn":"Holmes+on+Homes+-+Holmes+for+the+Holidays","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d11ad11591e547464846b8f1b0aefcc9809053f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,17,173,17,89,30,84,116,100,132,107,143,27,10,239,204,152,9,5,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
