You&amp;#039;ve bought stuff from them. But have you ever thought of actually building a shopping mall? Here&amp;#039;s your chance. Mall Tycoon is a strategy management sim with 250 stores to choose from, and 60 different commodities to mix and match. You control which stores go in your mall, but you must strike a balance of goods to bring in a wide range of customers. You&amp;#039;ll have to manage mall employees such as janitors and security guards, and deal with real mall problems like shoplifters, punks, and -- to add a dose of surrealism -- supernatural creatures. Devise marketing campaigns and special mall promotions like the Easter Bunny or live concerts. Best of all, you always know exactly where the bathrooms are.\n\nWorks With Deamon Tools\n\nDont forget to seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae73dd9c540a944a5c0d44cafeec6fce8f17079c","amp;dn":"Mall+Tycoon+1+%28PC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae73dd9c540a944a5c0d44cafeec6fce8f17079c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,115,221,156,84,10,148,74,92,13,68,202,254,236,111,206,143,23,7,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
