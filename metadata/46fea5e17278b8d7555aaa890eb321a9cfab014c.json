SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) is a system built into hard drives by their manufacturers to report on various measurements(called attributes) of a hard drive's operation. The attributes can be used to detect when a hard drive is having mechanical or electrical problems, and can indicate when the hard drive is failing. SMART Utility can read and display these attributes. This allows time to hopefully backup, and then replace the drive. SMART Utility also allows running a drive's built in self test, which can also indicate malfunctions on the drive.\n\n\n\nFeatures\nDisplays all supported drives and their partitions\nDisplays important information in the main window, such as drive model, capacity, power on hours, temperature, bad sector counts, and error counts and types\nDisplays easy to read overall SMART status with color coded text\nDisplays more detailed information in separate windows, including capabilities, all available attributes, and the past five errors\nDisplays information using the Growl notification service (if installed)\nSupports running a hard drive's built-in test, and displays the results of the test\nSupports scanning OS X software RAID drives, as well as drives in many RAID enclosures and cards (including SeriTek drives)\nSupports logging all information to a log file for verifying SMART data\nSupports customizing the pre-fail algorithm, including only alerting new bad sectors and error counts\nSupports Mac OS X 10.4.11 and 10.5 or later (including Server) and both PowerPC and Intel Macs\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46fea5e17278b8d7555aaa890eb321a9cfab014c","amp;dn":"SMART+Utility+2+build+1A155+%5BK%5D+%5BUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46fea5e17278b8d7555aaa890eb321a9cfab014c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,254,165,225,114,120,184,215,85,90,170,137,14,179,33,169,207,171,1,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
