Just look at this list of artists and writers from the Wikipedia entry above:\n\nBrian Michael Bendis and Mark Millar (#1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ6)\nWarren Ellis (#7Ã¢â‚¬â€œ18)\nMike Carey (#19Ã¢â‚¬â€œ20, 33Ã¢â‚¬â€œ57, Ultimate X4 #1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2, Annual 2)\nMark Millar (#21Ã¢â‚¬â€œ32, Annual 1)\nJoe Pokaski (#58Ã¢â‚¬â€œ60, FF/X-Men Annual #1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2, Ultimate Requiem)\n\nAdam Kubert (#1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ6, 13Ã¢â‚¬â€œ18)\nStuart Immonen (#7Ã¢â‚¬â€œ12, Annual 2)\nJae Lee (#19Ã¢â‚¬â€œ20, Annual 1)\nGreg Land (#21Ã¢â‚¬â€œ32)\nFrazer Irving (Annual 2)\nPasqual Ferry (#33Ã¢â‚¬â€œ38, 42Ã¢â‚¬â€œ46, Ultimate X4 #1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2)\nLeinil Francis Yu (Ultimate X4 #2)\nScott Kolins (#39Ã¢â‚¬â€œ41)\nMark Brooks (#39Ã¢â‚¬â€œ41, 47Ã¢â‚¬â€œ49)\nTyler Kirkham (#50Ã¢â‚¬â€œ60)\nEric Nguyen (FF/X-Men Annual #1)\nDan Panosian (FF/X-Men Annual #2)\n\nThat is...insane. The modern update features all the classics - Reed and Sue Richards, Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm - with new twists and exciting updates to many of the original tropes that made Marvel s famous and all with clear love and respect for Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's creations.\n\nThis is every issue of the series in digital copies by Empire scanners, along with 3 Annuals. The first 40 issues are HD/HR copies by AnHeroGold; there were also APG versions of these but I opted for the better quality editions for this pack. The remaining issues 41-60 are the 1280x rips by AnPymGold. Of the three annuals, two are by Cypher-Empire and the remaining is by APG. \nMassive thanks to all the Empire peeps for their work; please seed and enjoy! \n\nPlease visit and support my Suprbay release thread here, I would appreciate it: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-VikTSlick-s-Comics-Releases&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-VikTSlick-s-Comics-Releases&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7823a92db544a927c8b2df2bd24befc7130f4c1c","amp;dn":"Ultimate+Fantastic+Four+01-60+%2B+Ex+%282004-2009%7CDigital%7CEmpire%2B%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7823a92db544a927c8b2df2bd24befc7130f4c1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,35,169,45,181,68,169,39,200,178,223,43,210,75,239,199,19,15,76,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
