You are responsible for the line-up, the tactics and the training of your team ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ as well as for signing the right players, improving the club facilities and the stadium. It is also important that you maintain good relationships with your players, the board, the sponsors and the press. But FIFA Manager 09 goes further. Managing your national team is one of the options, playing as a player manager is another one (in this case you can even control your player on the pitch). And then there is the ultimate challenge: Found your own club and work your way up the leagues to finally become Champions!\n\nFeatures:\n3D Match\nThe new fully customizable user interface gives the user full control over the players on the pitch. Substitutions and tactical changes are just one mouse click away; tables, team and player stats can be displayed permanently on the screen if the user wants the information. FIFA Manager 09 includes a new crowd system with animated supporters, an improved stadium generator (this tool allows you to recreate every real-world stadium within minutes), a complete overhaul of the audio and further improved AI. An extreme tower camera allows the user to see every tactical detail on the pitch.\n\nNew Text Mode\nFIFA Manager 09 brings the text mode to the next level. The new mixture of Internet live ticker and traditional live commentary is both exciting and informative. Player skills and tactics become clearly visible. The massive use of the context of the match (importance, weather, fans, etc.) brings the text to life. Defenders and defending midfielders play a much bigger role than in previous text modes. Tactics can be changed on the fly without having to pause the match.\n\nA huge ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLive StatsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ section with match data, player stats and player comparison, tables, and scorer lists supports the userÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s decisions.\n\nThe special ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAssistant ManagerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ widget is especially important for beginners and helps them to optimize their tactics. The assistant analyzes the game minute by minute and informs the user about players with low fitness, bad performances, tactical problems etc.\n\nImproved Interface\nThe main menu widget system includes 10 new widgets, buttons to switch all widgets simultaneously and an option to rotate the widgets automatically. The new Search History gives the user easy access to previous club and player searches. FIFA Manager 09 supports up to 9 RSS Feeds in the live ticker.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c025a9a8aaf158a7e0c4d1e296cc0521f8b55bb","amp;dn":"Fifa+Manager+09+Demo+%5BWindows+Game%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c025a9a8aaf158a7e0c4d1e296cc0521f8b55bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,2,90,154,138,175,21,138,126,12,77,30,41,108,192,82,31,139,85,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
