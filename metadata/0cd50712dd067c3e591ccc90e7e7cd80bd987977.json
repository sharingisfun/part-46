Lucard' being 'Dracula' backwards.) and his struggles with Gustav Van Helsing, as well as Gustav's young nephews Ã¢â‚¬â€ Maximilian and Christopher Townsend. They were also aided by a schoolgirl, Sophie Metternich. Romantic tensions developed between Chris and Sophie. The series was filmed in Luxembourg, and produced by Phil Bedard and Larry Lalonde, best known for their work on John Woo's Once a Thief and Kung Fu: The Legend Continues.\nThe series formula was relatively straightforward, with the four heroes learning of some plot by Lucard/Dracula and attempting to foil it, with at least some success. In keeping with the novel, but not most film and television lore, vampires could walk in sunlight but lacked their powers. Anyone bitten just once by a vampire transformed into a zombie-like servant. This process could be stopped by applying holy water to the bite.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cd50712dd067c3e591ccc90e7e7cd80bd987977","amp;dn":"Dracula+-+The+Series+%281990%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cd50712dd067c3e591ccc90e7e7cd80bd987977","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,213,7,18,221,6,124,62,89,28,204,144,231,231,205,128,189,152,121,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
