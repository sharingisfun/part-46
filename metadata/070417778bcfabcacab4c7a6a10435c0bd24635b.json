This result gives scientists a chance to learn what happens when some of the largest objects in the universe go at each other in a cosmic free-for-all. Using data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, Hubble Space Telescope, and the Keck Observatory in Hawaii, astronomers were able to determine the three-dimensional geometry and motion in the system MACS J0717.5+3745 (or MACS J0717, for short), located about 5.4 billion light-years from Earth.\n\nAbout the Object  \t\nObject Name: \t        MACS J0717.5+3745\nObject Description: \tCluster of Galaxies\nPosition (J2000): \tR.A. 07h 17m 33s.80\n                        Dec. +37Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â° 45' 20&quot;.02\n\nConstellation: \t        Auriga\nDistance: \t        5.4 billion light-years or 1.7 billion parsecs\nDimensions: \t        The image is roughly 4.5 arcminutes (7.7 million ________________________light-years or 2.4 megaparsecs) wide.\n\nAbout the Chandra Data \t\nData Description: \tChandra data used were from proposal 4200.\nInstrument: \t        ACIS\nExposure Date(s): \tJanuary 10, 2003\nEnergies: \t        5 - 25 T(keV)\n\nAbout the Hubble Data \t\nData Description: \tThe Hubble images were created from HST data from proposal ________________________10420: PI: Dr. H.

Two filters were used to sample broad wavelength ranges. A continuous energy band was used to sample the X-ray data. The color results from assigning different hues (colors) to each monochromatic image. In this case, the assigned colors are:\n\nHubble:                F606W (V) \tcyan\nHubble:                F814W (I) \tyellow\n\nChandra: 5 - 25 T(keV) temperature map \tblue through violet","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:070417778bcfabcacab4c7a6a10435c0bd24635b","amp;dn":"Galaxy+Cluster+MACS+J0717","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"070417778bcfabcacab4c7a6a10435c0bd24635b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,4,23,119,139,207,171,202,202,180,199,166,161,4,53,192,189,36,99,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
