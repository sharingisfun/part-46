After the fall of Eurozone in 2014 and huge financial crisis,\nÃ‚Â  the Ukraine never finished the new sarcophagus for the Chernobyl Power\nÃ‚Â  Plant. With the old Dome constantly decaying, the radiation levels were\nÃ‚Â  increasing and very soon the zone was declared off limits to civilians - and\nÃ‚Â  closed. Shortly it became a shelter for escaping criminals, army deserters\nÃ‚Â  and all the society-unwanted scum.\n\nÃ‚Â  Dangerous, inhabited by potential targets and officially closed, the Zone\nÃ‚Â  became an ideal testing ground for military and private contractors. Combat\nÃ‚Â  equipment, weapons and electronics - tested by small teams or even\nÃ‚Â  standalone mercs. The player is one of the mercenaries sent into the Zone.\nÃ‚Â  Since he is the first who may make it alive through the Plant interiors, his\nÃ‚Â  mission has been handsomely paid for by the Death TV - and they hope for a\nÃ‚Â  good show, paying extra for every kill - the more gruesome, the higher the\nÃ‚Â  bid.\n\n\nÃ‚Â  1. UnRAR\nÃ‚Â  2. Burn/mount image with your favorite software\nÃ‚Â  3. Install game\n\nÃ‚Â  Tired about all the self-made CD/DVD images made from download versions of\nÃ‚Â  the games? Our games are made from physical sources if possible - like in\nÃ‚Â  the good old times and how we think it should still be done. In our opinion\nÃ‚Â  digital download versions should be tagged as such or at least it should be\nÃ‚Â  noted in the nfo. Also we think that physical sources never could be dupes\nÃ‚Â  of digital versions as well as CD versions are no dupes of DVD ones. All\nÃ‚Â  old and still active scene rules proof that we are right (the new S.I.R\nÃ‚Â  rules from 2009 and 2010 are not signed by any scene group and are not\nÃ‚Â  active because of that).\n\nÃ‚Â  We bring you games that other groups do not do. We are different, like us\nÃ‚Â  or hate us. You think some games that we release are crap? We do not care\nÃ‚Â  because we think that scene means that every game should be released.\n\nÃ‚Â  To rise the quality of our releases we now try to make all our releases\nÃ‚Â  both in normal image format (bin/cue or iso) as requested by the scene\nÃ‚Â  rules and also in clone (Alcohol 120%) format.\n  \nGREETINGS\nÃ‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  \n  0x0815 - 0x0007 - FLT - GENESiS - GREENPEACE - PROPHET - POSTMORTEM\nÃ‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Razor1911 - RELOADED - VACE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5cfcaba99f176a47ba746c287878c80cd576613","amp;dn":"Chernobyl_Underground-FASiSO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5cfcaba99f176a47ba746c287878c80cd576613","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,207,202,186,153,241,118,164,123,167,70,194,135,135,140,128,205,87,102,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
