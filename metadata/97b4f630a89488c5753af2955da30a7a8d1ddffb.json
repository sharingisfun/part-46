It chronicles the unique Harnas Wildlife Foundation in Namibia, where Marieta van der Merwe and her family, former wealthy cattle farmers, have sold land to buy and care for embattled wildlife. We meet Sam, the &quot;AIDS&quot; lion infected by mistake at a vet clinic. Boerjke, a baboon with epilepsy and Down syndrome. Savanna, the one-eyed lioness. And Marieta van der Merwe herself, the inspiring proprietor of Harnas who shares her home with needy wild animals. Survivor of an early life fraught with personal tragedy in the African Bush, she now devotes herself as care-giver and ambassador for wildlife and wildland. Told with insight, humor, and thrilling immediacy by author and Harnas volunteer Barbara Bennett, this story will captivate readers of all ages.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97b4f630a89488c5753af2955da30a7a8d1ddffb","amp;dn":"Soul+of+a+Lion%3A+One+Woman%27s+Quest+to+Rescue+Africa%27s+Refugees","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97b4f630a89488c5753af2955da30a7a8d1ddffb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,180,246,48,168,148,136,197,117,58,242,149,93,163,10,122,141,29,223,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
