Although most higher angels remain neutral, Gabriel has convinced the lower angels, the &quot;dogs of Heaven,&quot; called &quot;eight-balls&quot; by humans for their black eyes, to fight alongside him. Twenty-five years later, mankind survives in a few fortified cities. The Archangel Michael has chosen to side with humanity against Gabriel, living among humans in the fortified city of Vega (once Las Vegas) until the time a prophesied savior appears to save mankind.[6]\r\n\r\nOn this new Syfy show, humans have had to fight to survive following a horrific war. Similarly, TV shows have to struggle to attract positive ratings so they can survive. Will Dominion be renewed for a second season or become a cancelled casualty instead? Stay tuned.\r\n\r\nBased on the characters from the Legion movie, Dominion takes place 25 years into the future, after the â€œExtinction Warâ€ in which an army of lower angels waged a war against mankind. The showâ€™s cast includes Christopher Egan, Tom Wisdom, Carl Beukes, Alan Dale, Roxanne McKee, Anthony Head, Luke Allen-Gale, Shivani Ghai, and Rosalind Halstead.\r\n\r\nThe ratings are typically the best indication of a showâ€™s likelihood of staying on the air. The higher the ratings, the better the chances for survival. This chart will be updated as new ratings data becomes available","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c629cc97cb5009efe0281d0e544d627f292cb9c7","amp;dn":"Dominion+-+Season+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c629cc97cb5009efe0281d0e544d627f292cb9c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,41,204,151,203,80,9,239,224,40,29,14,84,77,98,127,41,44,185,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
