After a 15-year reign over the ring, they made history in 2008, becoming the first brothers in the sport to hold world titles at the same time. Through an engaging mix of candid interviews and absorbing fight footage, Klitschko offers a captivating glimpse into the makings of these champion boxing brothers. But who are these smart gentlemen of boxing, each with a PhD and fluent in four languages? Will Wladimir dominate Heavy Weight Boxing for another five years; and will Vitali, the politician, someday become the President of Ukraine? Will they really stick with the promise they made to their mother, never to fight against each other?\n\nGenre: Documentary | Biography | Sport\nIMDB rating: 7.8/10\nDirected by: Sebastian Dehnhardt\nStarring: Lamon Brewster, Chris Byrd and Bernd BÃƒÂ¶nte\n\nRelease Name: Klitschko.2011.BDRip.XviD-FiCO\nSize: 2 CD\nVideo: XviD, 624Ãƒâ€”352, 1663 kbit/s\nAudio: English, MP3, 128 kbit/s\nRuntime: 118min\n\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:359a5ba1be079701568b4f352aa4cbea6db89556","amp;dn":"Klitschko+2011+BDRip+XviD-FiCO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"359a5ba1be079701568b4f352aa4cbea6db89556","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,154,91,161,190,7,151,1,86,139,79,53,42,164,203,234,109,184,149,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
