On the DVD several songs recorded in Atlanta, GA on July 22, 2008 that were not included in the main set are available as bonus tracks.  This is because later in the tour the setlist was altered somewhat, replacing four songs.  This release contains all of the tracks from both setlists combined together in their correct placement to give the listener a full on Rush show that no one heard in this form at any of the shows.  Due to the editing/removal of the video intros to several songs on the CD version, this is all taken from the DVD audio.  Its in stereo 16/44.1 so you can all play it on your CD players.\n\nA 16/48 AC3 5.1 version is also available.\n\n01 Dream About Snakes\n02 Limelight\n03 Digital Man\n04 Entre Nous\n05 Ghost Of A Chance\n06 Mission\n07 Freewill\n08 The Main Monkey Business\n09 McKenzie Brothers Intro\n10 The Larger Bowl\n11 Secret Touch\n12 Red Barchetta\n13 Circumstances\n14 The Trees\n15 Between tHe Wheels\n16 Dreamline\n17 the Plane Of Dharma\n18 Far Cry\n19 Workin' Them Angels\n20 Spindrift\n21 Armor And Sword\n22 The Way The Wind Blows\n23 Subdivisions\n24 Natural Science\n25 Witch Hunt\n26 Malignant Narcissism\n27 Der Slagwerker\n28 Hope\n29 Distant Early Warning\n30 The Spirit Of Radio\n31 2112 Overture\n32 The Temples Of Syrink\n33 South Park Intro\n24 Tom Sawyer\n25 One Little Victory\n26 A Passage To Bangkok\n27 YYZ\n28 Thank God That Shite Is Over","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef128206c78733c535068e0d1db682dea34a99e6","amp;dn":"Rush+-+Snakes+%26amp%3B+Arrows+Live+%28expanded+by+%7D%7Beywood%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef128206c78733c535068e0d1db682dea34a99e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,18,130,6,199,135,51,197,53,6,142,13,29,182,130,222,163,74,153,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
