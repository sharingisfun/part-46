It was filmed and first screened in 1996 and released along with select prints of the film Stephen King's THINNER. It was released a year later internationally on VHS.\n\nThe film tells the story of a scary Maestro with supernatural powers, who is being forced out of a small town by its mayor. The movie includes a series of dance routines performed by Michael Jackson and his &quot;family&quot; of ghouls. Every song from the film was taken from Michael Jackson's HIStory and Blood on the Dance Floor albums.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:670ee0ab80ab7839913addfcec8913ecc1cb90db","amp;dn":"Michael+Jackson+Ghosts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"670ee0ab80ab7839913addfcec8913ecc1cb90db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,14,224,171,128,171,120,57,145,58,221,252,236,137,19,236,193,203,144,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
