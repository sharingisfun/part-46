At present, DOSBox running on a \nhigh-end machine will roughly be the equivalent of a 486 PC. The 0.60\nrelease has added support for &quot;protected mode&quot; allowing for more complex and\nrecent programs, but note that this support is still in an early stage of \ndevelopment and unlike the support for 386 real-mode games (or earlier) hasn't\nbeen completed yet. Also note that &quot;protected mode&quot; games need substantially \nmore resources and may require a much faster processor for you to run them\nproperly in DOSBox.\n\n\nAn essential program needed to play many older games on newer machines. Suprisingly for me this actually worked on a x64 bit system (vista x64 ultimate).\n\n\nInstructions are included within the file.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f395ba37dd2b16ed3804101c3655771a5ca8812e","amp;dn":"DOSBOX-0.65","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f395ba37dd2b16ed3804101c3655771a5ca8812e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,149,186,55,221,43,22,237,56,4,16,28,54,85,119,26,92,168,129,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
