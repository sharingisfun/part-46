When it was released, it became the fastest selling debut album in Britain since Oasis's Definitely Maybe. The album reached the #1 position in the UK charts, however in America it stalled at #200 in the Billboard charts.\n\nThe track &quot;Grateful When You're Dead/Jerry Was There&quot; is a homage to Jerry Garcia and his band The Grateful Dead. The Grateful Dead's psychedelic rock style is an influence on Kula Shaker's first and second albums. The hidden track after &quot;Hollow Man&quot; is a recording of A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, speaking about his own guru.\n\nThe cover art (by comic-book artist Dave Gibbons) consists of various images related to the letter K, including: John F. Kennedy, Lord Kitchener, Karl Marx, Gene Kelly, Katharine Hepburn, Ken Dodd, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Danny Kaye, Kal-El (Superman), Boris Karloff (as Frankenstein), Krishna, King Kong, Martin Luther King, Jr., 2 Knights (a pair of Keys on one of them), a Kettle, Kali, the Kaiser, Nikita Khrushchev, Grace Kelly, the number 11 (symbolizing K) and Rudyard Kipling's book Kim.\n\nIn 1998 K was placed at number 44 on Q's 100 greatest albums of all time list. In 2011, K once again made into a Q Magazine list for the 250 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_%28album%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_%28album%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nDisc 1:\n\n01.
