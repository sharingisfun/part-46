Emotion. The album consists of a collection of 14 tracks with several different new age artists songs appearing in this CD.\n\nFans of Delerium will be happy to know 'Flatlands' is included on Track 3, Enigma has two songs included Return To Innocence which is a remix (Track 9) and Beyond The Invisible (track 14) one of my all time favourite songs from Enigma.\n\nThe album is produced and engineered by Cretu and this presence by this great artist gives the album the glitz and buzz. This album is for any fan of great new age sounds that range from uplifting and resilent to soft and brooding. There is not one track that is not-litenable, all songs flow melodiously from one song to another and is a superb listening experience.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20b4752150326143b16b483c6fc1f2c3ff75da1d","amp;dn":"Enigma+-+D-Emotion+Project+%28Flac%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20b4752150326143b16b483c6fc1f2c3ff75da1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,180,117,33,80,50,97,67,177,107,72,60,111,193,242,195,255,117,218,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
