I don't know how well known they were outside of Brisbane but in their home town they were nothing short of absolute legends. Their live shows were a blast and always something to look forward to. Their music was hmmm.... I guess a mixture of metal,punk,hardcore,thrash with a dash of whatever thrown in. These recordings are long out of print and I guess original copies are quite rare. For those who were looking for these in that other torrent... enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2e4dc807abcabd8849c071d9b2c0c59609c328d","amp;dn":"Dreamkillers+first+3+eps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2e4dc807abcabd8849c071d9b2c0c59609c328d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,228,220,128,122,188,171,216,132,156,7,29,155,44,12,89,96,156,50,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
