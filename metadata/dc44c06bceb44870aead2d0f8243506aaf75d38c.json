Tears In Heaven - Eric Clapton \n\nGrammy&amp;#039;s Greatest Moments, Vol. 2 gathers more live performances from the awards-show telecast; while there isn&amp;#039;t much rhyme or reason as to which songs were selected here, or what years they were taken from, the common thread of high performance quality helps tie the collection together. The concentration tends to be on the &amp;#039;80s and &amp;#039;90s, and on mainstream pop/rock, although there&amp;#039;s a bit of R&amp;B (Terence Trent D&amp;#039;Arby&amp;#039;s &quot;If You Let Me Stay,&quot; Aretha Franklin&amp;#039;s &quot;Respect&quot;) and hard rock (Aerosmith&amp;#039;s &quot;Come Together&quot;). Other highlights include Mariah Carey&amp;#039;s &quot;Vision of Love,&quot; Billy Joel&amp;#039;s &quot;We Didn&amp;#039;t Start the Fire,&quot; k.d. lang&amp;#039;s &quot;Constant Craving,&quot; Eric Clapton&amp;#039;s &quot;Tears in Heaven,&quot; and Huey Lewis and the News&amp;#039; &quot;The Heart of Rock &amp;#039;n&amp;#039; Roll.&quot; ~ Steve Huey, All Music Guide\n\n07/13/2005 5:42 AM, AMG","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc44c06bceb44870aead2d0f8243506aaf75d38c","amp;dn":"VA+-+Grammy%5C%27s+Greatest+Moments+Volume+II+-+1994","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc44c06bceb44870aead2d0f8243506aaf75d38c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,68,192,107,206,180,72,112,174,173,45,15,130,67,80,106,175,117,211,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
