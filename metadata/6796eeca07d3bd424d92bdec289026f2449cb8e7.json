It is similar to the Pure Land Sect chant of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Namu Amita ButsuÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ &amp; the Tibetan chant Ã¢â‚¬Å“Om Amitabah HreehÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Written Tibetan prayers on wheels are spun to churn the ethers with a certain vibration &amp; call. That principle is applied sonically, in this spinning musical prayer, with many layers of harmonic fifths tuned to Solfeggio tones. The binaural beats initially ramp down from Alpha to Delta. During the ramp-down there is a high Theta spike held to aid in the induction lucid dreaming. Then the entrainment shifts down &amp; pulses around the high Delta range for the rest of this enchanting meditation. \n\n64 min \n\nreference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917 \nSource: WebRip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6796eeca07d3bd424d92bdec289026f2449cb8e7","amp;dn":"Unisonic+Ascension+-+Amida+Sonic+Prayer+Wheel+%28Alpha+to+Delta%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6796eeca07d3bd424d92bdec289026f2449cb8e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,150,238,202,7,211,189,66,77,146,189,236,40,144,38,242,68,156,184,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
