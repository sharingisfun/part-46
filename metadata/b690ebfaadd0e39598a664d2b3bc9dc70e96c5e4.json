I also caught the BBC2 broadcast, but only on VHS. Bear this in mind, it&amp;#039;s all relevant. \n\nSecondly, although I haven&amp;#039;t tackled them about this as yet, Virgin (formerly NTL) are inexplicably supplying mono sound to my TV package. \n\nThirdly, The Yamada DVR8000 produces discs that, when ripped onto a PC, do not read all the way to the end of the recording (what? why?) and the last few moments get left off. \n\nFourthly, my entire @$&amp;*ing life seems to be riddled with these frustrating gremlins, no matter what I do. For example, I recently upgraded my broadband connection, which is great, but when it&amp;#039;s working at full-tilt my TV controls slow down alarmingly, presumably because my set-top box is also my cable modem but, then again, why should this be? Consequently, if I&amp;#039;m watching TV, or I&amp;#039;m using an internet browser, I ain&amp;#039;t seeding.\n \nIn a nutshell, what&amp;#039;s wrong with this DVD can be summed up as follows:\n1. Restored (very slightly) inferior quality credits/ending.\n2. Sound too loud\n3. Mono\n\nOK, so now you know. If you don&amp;#039;t want it, don&amp;#039;t download it. What do I care?\n\nI bought another DVD recorder last week, because the Yamada was so crap that it didn&amp;#039;t do the job that I wanted it to, ie dubbing my VHS tapes to digital. I now have an Hitachi DV-DS161E DVD recorder, with hard drive. So far so good. Remember that I have a disc of this show from the Yamada which doesn&amp;#039;t fully rip to a PC for editing? Of course, I want the whole thing, especially as the ending credits are an absolute treat, but the rip misses them off. So what do I do? I dub the Yamada disc to the Hitachi, right? Wrong! The damned Hitachi seems to think that the Yamada disc has copy-protection and won&amp;#039;t record. Remember that I only need the credits. So I dig out the VHS version from BBC2 in order to rip just the credits, but the bloody Hitachi detects Macrovision on that too and, again, won&amp;#039;t record them. I had to take the original Yamada disc, dub it to VHS and then dub the resulting VHS to the Hitachi in order to get a copy of the credits at all. But I did it. I don&amp;#039;t give up without a fight. \n\nDetails of rip:\n1. Main programme: Yamada DVR8000 &gt; SmartRipper &gt; DGIndex &gt; TMPGEnc Plus 2.5 &gt; TMPGEnc DVD Author 3 &gt; You\n\n2.
