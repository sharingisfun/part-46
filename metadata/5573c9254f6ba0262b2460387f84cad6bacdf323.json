She's loquacious to a fault. When kids at a career day make fun of her for being single, she accepts a blind date with Steve, the cameraman for a CNN-like news network. Within minutes she decides he's the man for her. He's quickly put off by her constant verbiage and over-the-top advances; he makes an off-hand remark about going on the road with her, and splits. She's moonstruck, writes a sappy crossword puzzle, loses her job, and decides to follow him as the news team crisscrosses the Southwest; Steve's team eggs her on. Then she falls in a mine shaft, and she and Steve become a story; is it a love story?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5573c9254f6ba0262b2460387f84cad6bacdf323","amp;dn":"All+About+Steve","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5573c9254f6ba0262b2460387f84cad6bacdf323","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,115,201,37,79,107,160,38,43,36,96,56,127,132,202,214,186,205,243,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
