Essentially the equivalent of Superman, Icon too was an alien.  Unlike Superman, he had a sidekick in Rocket who kept him rooted in the problems suffered today.  This torrent contains the original series (with a few issues missing).  He also featured prominently in the Rift Milestone/DC crossover in the 90s.\nRecently he appeared as one of the major characters appearing in JLA 28. He also recently appeared after the events of New Krypton with Sam Lane keeping tabs on him\n\nDefinitely an enjoyable read.\nThis torrent will take a few days to finish ULing as I will be in and out of high-speed internet.\nEnjoy and Seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f26a4c04d928264d3bc410c1f4e5be5179524e04","amp;dn":"Icon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f26a4c04d928264d3bc410c1f4e5be5179524e04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,106,76,4,217,40,38,77,59,196,16,193,244,229,190,81,121,82,78,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
