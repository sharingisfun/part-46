Bealle&amp;#039;s classic book Washington Squirrel Cage - The Story of the New Deal in Satire (1948) which tells a factual story hidden in a satire of the Washington&amp;#039;s political trickery of the New Deal from 1933 onwards. Bealle, a former city editor of the old Washington Times and Herald, used his professional experience to do some deep digging into the freedom-of-the-press situation and came up with two shattering exposes - The Drug Story and The House of Rockefeller. In Squirrel Cage he brilliantly exposes the utopian policy of New Deal which robbed millions of whatever they had left - all for the pleasure of the superrich. An unknown literary masterpiece that will make you laugh and educate you at the same time as Bealle makes fun of just about every politician and political party of the time and gives a profound lesson to be used at anytime - perhaps even today. 130 pages. A must read for everyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a8ee628aeba1a25224b952477beaf9e995dcc05","amp;dn":"Bealle-Washington+Squirrel+Cage%28New+Deal+satire%29%281948%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a8ee628aeba1a25224b952477beaf9e995dcc05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,142,230,40,174,186,26,37,34,75,149,36,119,190,175,158,153,93,204,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
