Cobbled together from a variety of recording sessions mostly between August and September 1970, its sound can be best described as the antithesis to any of the group's classic recordings (such as 1973's Dixie Chicken and 1978's Waiting For Columbus.) Featuring the Mk. 1 line-up of the group, with Roy Estrada on bass, it was the first of eight albums by the group before their 1979 break-up.\n\nThe blues which accented the group's later recordings were in full force on Little Feat. Utilizing slide guitar legend Ry Cooder, the group knocked off a medley of two Howlin' Wolf songs, &quot;Forty Four Blues&quot; and &quot;How Many More Years&quot;. The coming together of bizarre lyrics and superb instrumentation that dominated all Little Feat albums through Lowell George's tenure as leader were debuted with the dark &quot;Hamburger Midnight&quot;. The brilliant slices of American life that were present on each album were debuted with &quot;Strawberry Flats&quot; and &quot;Willin'&quot; (the latter destined for a reworking on Sailin' Shoes). The tender side of the group was exemplified with tracks like &quot;Truck Stop Girl&quot; and &quot;I've Been The One&quot;.\n\nThe cover shows a mural in Venice, painted by the L. A. Fine Arts Squad in 1970 - &quot;Venice in the Snow&quot;.\n\nDue to its relative failure commercially (only selling about eleven thousand copies), the group never again attempted to record anything like it.\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nLowell George - vocals, lead, rhythm and slide guitars, harmonica\nRichard Hayward - drums, backing vocals\nBill Payne - piano, keyboards, vocals\nRoy Estrada - bass, backing vocals\n\n\nAdditional Personnel\n\nRuss Titelman - percussion, backing vocals, piano on &quot;I've Been The One&quot;\nRy Cooder - slide guitar on &quot;Willin'&quot; and &quot;Forty Four Blues / How Many More Years&quot;\nSneaky Pete Kleinow - pedal steel on &quot;I've Been The One&quot;\nKirby Johnson - string and horn arrangements\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.&quot;Snakes on Everything&quot; (Payne) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:04\n2.&quot;Strawberry Flats&quot; (Payne, George) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:20\n3.&quot;Truck Stop Girl&quot; (Payne, George) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:32\n4.&quot;Brides of Jesus&quot; (Payne, George) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20\n5.&quot;Willin'&quot; (George) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:24\n6.&quot;Hamburger Midnight&quot; (George, Estrada) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:30\n7.&quot;Forty-Four Blues / How Many More Years&quot; (Chester Burnett) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:25\n8.&quot;Crack in Your Door&quot; (George) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:16\n9.&quot;I've Been the One&quot; (George) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:20\n10.&quot;Takin' My Time&quot; (Payne) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45\n11.&quot;Crazy Captain Gunboat Willie&quot; (Payne, George) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:55\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f797dc835f0bc51e48679f4915b37bd08761a2d5","amp;dn":"Little+Feat+-+Little+Feat++%5B1971%5D++%5BRobbie60%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f797dc835f0bc51e48679f4915b37bd08761a2d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,151,220,131,95,11,197,30,72,103,159,73,21,179,123,208,135,97,162,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
