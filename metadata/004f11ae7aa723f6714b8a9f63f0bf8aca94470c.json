Previously titled Present, the album was produced by Nellee Hooper whose credits include U2, Gwen Stefani, Madonna, and BjÃƒÂ¶rk and was executively produced by U2's Bono. String arrangements were by Anne Dudley and Michael Jennings. The album was released on 25 June 2007 with the lead single &quot;Shame on You (to Keep My Love from Me)&quot; released on 18 June 2007.  All the songs on the album were composed by Andrea herself save for a cover of the first Squeeze hit &quot;Take Me I'm Yours&quot;.  Sales have generally been very poor despite the high promotion for the album and generally favourable reviews. The album failed to make an impact in most of Europe and Australia where it peaked at a very low #98 on the Australian ARIA Album Chart. The album peaked at #38 in the UK but soon dropped down the chart. The album achieved quite good sales in Spain, peaking inside the Top 10 within the first week after it was released..\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Hello Boys\n[02] Anybody There\n[03] Shame On You (To Keep My Love From Me)\n[04] I Do\n[05] Ten Feet High\n[06] Champagne From A Straw\n[07] 24 Hours\n[08] This Is What It's All About\n[09] Take Me I'm Yours\n[10] Stupidest Girl In The World\n[11] Ideal World\n[12] Shame On You (To Keep My Love From Me) [Radio Mix]\n\nPlay Time - 00h:38m:18s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 97.9mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
