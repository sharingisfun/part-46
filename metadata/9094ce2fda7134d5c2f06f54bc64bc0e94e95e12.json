In Halo, you control the Master Chief, an enhanced soldier awakened from cryogenic sleep to save humankind from a nasty group of aliens called the Covenant. Although the PC version only adds a few maps and loses the cooperative mode, the impressive graphics, exciting gameplay, and variety of weapons and vehicles make Halo worth a try for any fans of first-person shooters.\n\nFirst run the setup, next run Halo.exe to start the game.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9094ce2fda7134d5c2f06f54bc64bc0e94e95e12","amp;dn":"Halo+Combat+Evolved+%5BMultiplayer+%2B+All+Maps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9094ce2fda7134d5c2f06f54bc64bc0e94e95e12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,148,206,47,218,113,52,213,194,240,111,84,188,100,188,14,148,233,94,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
