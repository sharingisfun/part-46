Are you up to the challenge?\nDid we mention the HuntsmanÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ in the mazeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ stalking you?\nDid we mention he may also be lurking in Grimhaven Orphanage? \n\nSo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ how fast can you turn and run? Well you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know Ã¢â‚¬Ëœtill you check it out! \nSo go do it! Have fun!! Scare yourself as much as you want \n(maybe you should keep the hallway light onÃ¢â‚¬Â¦!)\n\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nMAKE SURE YOU INSTALLED 'WINESKIN WINERY' ON YOUR SYSTEM\n\nQuestions &amp; Answers\n_________________\n\nQ: Why is my screen-brightness adjusted as soon as I launch the game?\nA: Because the 'wrapper's' gamma is adjusted so you can actually see something in-game.\n\nQ: The game is too light or too dark on my system, what can I do?\nA: Holt the alt/option key on your mac keyboard when double-clicking the game &gt; Go to: 'Set Screen Options' &gt; Adjust the gamme correction by using the slider.\n\nQ: There's only only resolution available when I launch the game, how can I play at a different resolution?\nA: Holt the alt/option key on your mac keyboard when double-clicking the game &gt; Go to: 'Set Screen Options' &gt; Change 'Current Resolution' to the resolution you want.\n\nQ: My normal mouse pointer shows up on top of the game window, how can I fix this?\nA: You can't really fix it. You can, however, switch to a different window and then switch back to the game. \nYou'll see that your mouse pointer isn't showing anymore, but it's just for the time being, since it's somehow a simulator thats running and not an actually full screen thingy.\n\nQ: Whatsup with the checkbox named 'Windowed' when I start the game and why it's (un)checked?\nA: Don't be scared, click (/check) it and see what happens. Personally, I find it more attractive to leave it unchecked, but it's up to you.\n\n\nENJOY THE GAME!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c452bb036dbe9d49ff0dcaf7e41734b685f43757","amp;dn":"Huntsman+-+The+Orphanage+%5BWineGame%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c452bb036dbe9d49ff0dcaf7e41734b685f43757","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,82,187,3,109,190,157,73,255,13,202,247,228,23,52,182,133,244,55,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
