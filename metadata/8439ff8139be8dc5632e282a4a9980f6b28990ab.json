It was the first to feature the new band lineup of Willcox, Joel Bogen, Phil Spalding, Nigel Glocker and Adrian Lee.\nThis was the breakthrough single for the band, reaching #4 in the UK singles charts on the back of its lead track, It&amp;#039;s A Mystery. The single also marked the band&amp;#039;s first legendary appearance on Top Of The Pops.\n&quot;It&amp;#039;s A Mystery&quot; would later appear on the album Anthem, however the other three tracks from this EP would not appear on an album until the original CD release of &quot;Anthem&quot; in 1985. Many years later, these tracks would appear on other compilations and the eventual 1999 CD reissue of &quot;Anthem&quot; itself. They were also featured on the 2005 compilation The Safari Singles Collection Part 1: 1979-1981.\nIn several territories, &quot;It&amp;#039;s A Mystery&quot; was released as a standalone single instead of being part of an EP.\t\t\n\nToyah It&amp;#039;s a Mystery Lyrics:\n\nSomewhere in the distance\nHidden from view\nSuspended in the atmosphere\nWaiting to come through\nSometimes it&amp;#039;s so far away\nSometimes it&amp;#039;s very near\nsound being carried by the wind\nJust loud enough to hear\nfeel its power within me\nBells ringing in my head\nSo often I have heard its cry\nBut forgotten what it said\nIt&amp;#039;s a mystery, it&amp;#039;s a mystery\n\nI&amp;#039;m still searching for a clue\nIt&amp;#039;s a mystery to me\nshot in the dark\nThe big question mark in history\nIs it a mystery to you?\nIt can treat you with a vengeance\nTrip you in the dark\nSirens in the distance\nCan steer you from the path\nIt can lift you to the heavens\nPut your troubles in the past\nWhisper the elixir\nThen vanish in a blast\nIt&amp;#039;s a mystery, it&amp;#039;s a mystery\nI&amp;#039;m still searching for a clue\nIt&amp;#039;s a mystery to me\nshot in the dark\nThe big question mark in history\nIs it a mystery to you?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8439ff8139be8dc5632e282a4a9980f6b28990ab","amp;dn":"TOTP+-+Toyah+-+It%5C%27s+A+Mystery","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8439ff8139be8dc5632e282a4a9980f6b28990ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,57,255,129,57,190,141,197,99,46,40,42,74,153,128,246,178,137,144,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
