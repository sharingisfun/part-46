Empowered by the new unique data recovery technologies, it is the most comprehensive data recovery solution for recovery files from FAT12/16/32, NTFS, NTFS5 (created or updated by Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista), HFS/HFS+ (Macintosh), Little and Big Endian variants of UFS1/UFS2 (FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD/Solaris) and Ext2FS/Ext3FS (Linux) partitions. It functions on local and network disks, even if such partitions are formatted, damaged or deleted. Flexible parameter settings give you absolute control over data recovery. \n\n\nR-Studio utilities recover files:\n- Deleted without Recycle Bin, or when Recycle Bin has been emptied; \n- Removed by virus attack or power failure; \n- After the partition with the files was reformatted, even for different file system; \n- When the partition structure on a hard disk was changed or damaged. In this case, R-Studio utilities can scan the hard disk trying to find previously existed partitions and recover files from found partitions. \n- From hard disk with bad sectors. R-Studio Data Recovery Software can first copy the entire disk or its part into an image file and then process such image file. This is especially useful when new bad sectors are constantly appearing on the hard disk, and remaining information must be immediately saved. \n\nR-Studio Data Recovery Features :\n- Standard &quot;Windows Explorer&quot; - style interface. \n- Host OS: Windows 9x, ME, NT, 2000, XP, 2003 Server, Vista. \n- Data recovery over the Network. Files can be recovered on network computers running Win95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP/2003/Vista, Macintosh, Linux and UNIX. \n- Supported file systems: FAT12, FAT16, FAT32,NTFS, NTFS5 (created or updated by Win2000/XP/2003/Vista), HFS/HFS+ (Macintosh), Little and Big Endian variants of UFS1/UFS2 (FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD/Solaris) and Ext2FS/Ext3FS (Linux). \n- Recognition and parsing Dynamic (Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista), Basic(MBR) and BSD (UNIX) partitions layout schema and Apple partition map. Dynamic partitions over GPT are supported as well as dynamic partitions over MBR. \n- Damaged RAID recovery. If OS cannot recognize your RAID, you can create a virtual RAID from its components. Such virtual RAID can be processed like a real one. \n- Creates IMAGE FILES for an entire Hard Disk, Partition or its part. Such image files can be compressed and split into several files to put it on CD/DVD/Flash or FAT16/FAT32. Then the image files can be processed like regular disks. \nData recovery on damaged or deleted partitions, encrypted files (NTFS 5), alternative data streams (NTFS, NTFS 5). \n- Recovering data if: \n* FDISK or other disk utilities have been run; \n* VIRUS has invaded; FAT is damaged; MBR is destroyed. \n- Recognizes localized names. \n- Recovered files can be saved on any (including network) disks accessible by the host operating system. \n- File or disk content can be viewed and edited with the advanced hexadecimal editor. The editor supports NTFS file attribute editing. \n\nNew R-Studio features in version 4.0:\n# HFS and HFS+ file systems support. In addition to FAT/NTFS/ExtFS2/ExtFS3/UFS1/UFS2 R-Studio supports HFS and HFS+ file systems developed by Apple Computer for use on computers running Mac OS.\n* R-Studio can not be installed under Mac OS, but a hard drive with HFS and/or HFS+ partitions can be attached to Windows machine and processed by R-Studio.\n# Apple Computers support. New R-Studio Emergency version can be run from CD on Intel-based Macintosh computers.\n# Big Endian variant of UFS support.\n# GPT partition layout schema support. This schema is used in 64-bit Windows OS.\n# APM support. Apple Partition Map (APM) is a partition scheme used to define the low-level organization of data on disks formatted for use with Macintosh computers.\n# R-Studio Technician Portable was added to R-Studio Technician package. The portable version can be run from a USB storage device.\n# Compressed image format support. When R-Studio creates an image of the disk or its part, the image can be compressed and split into several files to put it on CD/DVD/Flash Drive or FAT16/FAT32.\n* R-Studio reads and opens the created image only for the purpose of data recovery. For disk imaging and restoration tasks please consider R-Drive Image software.\n\nHomepage - http://www.r-studio.com/\n\n\n\n\nScan:KIS 2009 -clear\n\nNo cracks\nNo Keygens\nonly serial","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f143203c95d92197cddb7a3fce7a35e64333d483","amp;dn":"R-Studio+4.5+Build+127456+%7BENG+FULL%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f143203c95d92197cddb7a3fce7a35e64333d483","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,67,32,60,149,217,33,151,205,219,122,63,206,122,53,230,67,51,212,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
