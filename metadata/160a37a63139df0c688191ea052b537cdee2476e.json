This  lays the  ground for  an impressive  amount of applications \n   like:     \n             \n   - Choir generator \n   - Harmonizer \n   - Voice doubler \n   - Change voice's gender \n   - Pitch corrector \n   - Extreme voice manipulation \n             \n   The 16 pitch shifters inside KLON are divided into 4 groups making it easy \n   to build up large choral parts from a simple, single vocal line. The  four \n   separate,  switchable groups  have their  own dedicated  set of  controls. \n   These controls  include an  x-y pad  for fast,  easy control  of pitch and \n   panorama. Each group can be altered in real time while music is playing or \n   can be by-passed, edited and switched back on when required. The pitch for \n   each group can be shifted by up to +/- two octaves with adjustable formant \n   control retaining  voice quality  even at  extreme settings.  All of those \n   controls are available for  host automation for unsurpassed  dynamic voice \n   manipulations. \n             \n   KLON includes a flexible and  adaptive pitch correction to any  given scale \n   or external MIDI notes and chords. Think of playing a chord to  immediately \n   harmonizing your vocal input. \n             \n   The  realtime  manipulation  possibilities together  with  the  low latency \n   operation makes KLON the ideal live plugin for vocals. \n\n\n                                                          \n                         \n                                   \n                  \n                                        \n                  1) Unzip, Unrar and run Setup.exe \n                            \n                  2) Enjoy this fine Team AiR release !!! \n\n\n                       \n                                      \n               \n                                                    nFO bY ThE AiRBEARS 2009  \n\n   Unfortunately the vst2 and vst3 version of this plugin can't co-exist in C5\n   In this plugin the vst3 version takes priority over the vst2 version\n   delete the vst3 version from c:program filescommon filesVST3\n   restart Cubase 5 and the vst2 version will appear","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:160a37a63139df0c688191ea052b537cdee2476e","amp;dn":"VirSyn.Klon.VST.RTAS.v1.0.2-AiR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"160a37a63139df0c688191ea052b537cdee2476e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,10,55,166,49,57,223,12,104,129,145,234,5,43,83,124,222,226,71,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
