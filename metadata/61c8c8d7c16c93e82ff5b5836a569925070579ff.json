Cutting\ntheir first session even before their debut single\nHush was released in the summer of '68, the band\nwere frequently visitors to the BBC studios over the\nnext two years. Several of the versions here have\nnever been issued before, others were never recorded\nelsewhere. The material (which at times is from less\nthan perfect surviving audio sources) ranges from\nenergetic guitar heavy versions of early tracks\nthrough to a blistering set from the monumental In\nRock album. This 2CD set includes a detailed booklet\nwith full session details and history\n\nDeep Purple are a British rock band formed in\nHertford in 1968. They are considered to be among\nthe pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock\nalthough their musical approach changed over the\nyears. Originally formed as progressive rock band\nthe band's sound shifted to hard rock in 1970. Deep\nPurple, together with Led Zeppelin and Black\nSabbath, have been referred to as the &quot;unholy\ntrinity of British hard rock and heavy metal in the\nearly to mid-Seventies&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Purple&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Purple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.deeppurple.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.deeppurple.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nL E T .
