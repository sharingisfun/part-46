You are a fighter pilot whose cryopod has been collected by a possibly-insane AI, who has placed you in the unenviable position of being humanityâ€™s savior. Shanghaied and alone, you must gather the remaining human survivors and traverse the surprising biodiversity of deep space to find a new home.\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n\r\n    Quick Gameplay - Pilot your ship in fast-paced shoot-em-up, featuring a unique approach to arcade physics and controls.\r\n    Customize Your Ship - Upgrade your ship with a Tetris-styled hangar bay as you find weapons and items on your quest.\r\n    Randomized Universe - Make your way through a diverse galaxy as you encounter interesting new lifeforms. Each play session generates a new path of enemies, allies, and items.\r\n    Casual Roguelike - When your ship blows up, that's the end of the line for that game. However, if you collect enough crystal shards by the end of a sector you can save your ship to re-launch it on another level.\r\n    A Fleet Of Ships To Play - Do you prefer fast ships for run and gun? Do you like something that takes a punch but isn't as agile? Start the game with 3 different ships and spend shards to unlock more ships with unique abilities!\r\n    Mod-friendly - Since ships and weapons are exposed in simple external .lua scripts, modding and creating your own content only requires a text editor!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05c519fe645a7be0c6242e39a40e3026a274a9b2","amp;dn":"Starship+Rubicon+v2.14","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05c519fe645a7be0c6242e39a40e3026a274a9b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,197,25,254,100,90,123,224,198,36,46,57,164,14,48,38,162,116,169,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
