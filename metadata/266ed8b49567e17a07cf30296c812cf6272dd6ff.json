Football Manager 2013 celebrates 20 years of games from\nthe people at Sports Interactive by introducing an array of new features\n\nThis year s version allows you to take control of any club in more than 50\nnations across the world and includes all of Europes biggest leagues as\nwell as database of over 500,000 real-world players and staff\n\nAs well as some landmark new features in the Career Mode, there are now new\nways to enjoy your Football Manager experience\n\nNEW TO CAREER MODE\n\nMatch Engine\nThe 3D match engine has seen huge improvements this year. Everything on the\npitch looks more realistic; from the stadiums, the players movement\nintelligence, and the way the ball moves through the air\n\nWe ve also introduced hundreds of new animations to make the game feel more\nrealistic and we ve made the whole experience more televisual by\nintroducing new camera angles and showing the kick-off and final whistle\n\nManager Roles\nAnother notable difference is the significant restructure of the manager s\nstaff and a revamp of their roles. The most obvious is that we ve\nintroduced the position of Director of Football into the game for the first\ntime, which will allow managers to pass on some of their workload, such as\ncontract negotiations, if they choose to\n\nIn addition to this, we ve also increased the number of specialist coaching\nroles within the game and given the manager greater flexibility to choose\nwhich coaches offer advice and when. The manager can also choose to\ncomplain about boardroom interference although that particular option\nshould probably be used sparingly\n\nAnd much more\n\nINSTALLATION INFORMATION:\n\nUnpack, mount and install\nNote: if the game crashes unexpectectly, remove Sports Interactive folder in\n/Users/XXXXXXXX/Library/Cache (has nothing to do with the crack)\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOpen dmg, when you have done that you will get a new file ''Football Manager 2013''\nin the new file there is a FM13 ikon klick on that and start your game :)\n\n\nTHIS IS ONLY FOR MAC!!!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:266ed8b49567e17a07cf30296c812cf6272dd6ff","amp;dn":"Football_Manager_2013_MACOSX-MONEY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"266ed8b49567e17a07cf30296c812cf6272dd6ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,110,216,180,149,103,225,122,7,207,48,41,108,129,44,246,39,45,214,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
