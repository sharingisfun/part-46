They are looking for a lone passerby to mug, and perhaps knock out a couple teeth for good measure. The townspeople live in fear of the dark streets. Well, not everyone. Meet Severe Jack - big tough guy who is not afraid to kick some bad guy ass. Today he came out of the sports arena and discovered that someone had stolen his car. That was the last straw. Severe Jack is going hunting.\nHere is a nice example of a very rare game genre on the PC ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ beat 'em up. The game was made in the best traditions of street fight platformers. Clear the levels, retaking the street from the bad guys, using only your fists. Lots of fighting moves - combos, airstrikes, and throws. Lively music and dynamic gameplay!\n\nSystem Requirements:\n- Operating system Microsoft Windows 98, XP, Vista, Win7\n- Pentium 3 and above\n- 256 MB RAM\n- Video card with 32 MB memory\n- The sound device compatible with DirectX 9","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a60b04a7e946378ea32b7a25b6fc5357cc58a412","amp;dn":"Street+Karate+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a60b04a7e946378ea32b7a25b6fc5357cc58a412","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,11,4,167,233,70,55,142,163,43,122,37,182,252,83,87,204,88,164,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
