The band who has had three\nconsecutive #1 albums in their native UK and have played sold out shows\nthroughout the US will also soon announce tour dates in North America for this\ncoming Spring.\n\nNight Train features eight powerful new tracks which were written and recorded\nduring the bandÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s Perfect Symmetry world tour that saw them playing to packed\narenas in 28 countries.\nThe album takes its title from the band's favorite mode of transportation during\nthe tour, and includes Keane's genre-busting collaborations with Somali/Canadian\nrapper K'Naan, 'Stop For A Minute' and 'Looking Back'.\n\n&quot;I think these tracks show us in a completely different light.&quot; says Keane\nfrontman Tom Chaplin.\n\nOther highlights include 'Ishin Denshin (You've Got To HelpYourself)', which\nfeatures Japanese MC Tigarah, as well as the gorgeous 'Your Love', which hangs\naround a rare lead vocal from the band's Ivor Novello-winning songwriter Tim\nRice-Oxley.\n\nKeane, who are Tom Chaplin, Richard Hughes, and Tim Rice-Oxley; together they\nhave sold close to 10 million albums copies of their albums Hopes And Fears\n(2004), Under The Iron Sea (2006) and Perfect Symmetry (2008). They have played\nsold-out arena tours, and were the musical guest on Saturday Night Live. With\nsongs such as Is It Any Wonder?, Everybody's Changing, Crystal Ball and\nSomewhere Only We Know, Keane is one of Britain's best-loved bands and will\nsurprise and thrill their fans all over again.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nInfo:\n\nLike it?
