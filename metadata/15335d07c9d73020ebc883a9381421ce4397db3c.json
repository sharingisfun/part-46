Eset Smart Security offers more than just a sum of its parts ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ it is synergy that matters most. If all components are used simultaneously, the effectiveness of the whole program is multiplied. ESET Smart Security unifies all its functions to create a complex security solution.\n\nESET Smart Security is based on three basic pillars:\n\nESET NOD32 Antivirus + Antispyware\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· This component is in fact an improved version of the award-winning scanning engine of NOD32 Antivirus v2.7. With respect to program's unprecedented scanning speed, the following improvements have been made:\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Improved system of cleaning and deleting infiltrations. The antivirus system now intelligently cleans and deletes infiltrations with no need for user interaction.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Computer scan can be run in background in order to use only a part of system resources. Thus scanning will not affect the performance of your computer and you will be able to work on it as usual.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· The resident protection supports archive scanning.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Update optimization, smaller update package size than in version 2.7, more effective management and protection of update files against damage.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Email protection for users of Outlook Express.\n\nESET Personal Firewall\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Firewall monitors all traffic between a protected computer and other computers in the local network and in the Internet. High quality protection is provided by the following functions:\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Scanning of application protocols HTTP and POP3 (used for Internet browsing and for retrieving email from servers) for infiltrations.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Checking low-level network communication which helps to avoid many of various remote attacks.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Ability to recognize the character of network connections established by various types of infiltrations and ability to automatically terminate them.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Filtering of incoming and outgoing communication based on user defined rules.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Monitoring changes in executable files.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Interactive and automatic mode. The former enables you to create your own filtering rules, the latter filters all communication automatically.\n\nESET Anti Spam\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· ESET Anti Spam serves to filter unsolicited email, which makes your work with email more effective. The key features of the ESET Anti Spam are:\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Support for the RCF email format\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Supports several scanning techniques including the combination of Bayesian filter, virus signatures and user defined rules.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Supports the creation of Blacklist and Whitelist.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Integration with the Microsoft Outlook messaging and collaboration client.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Ability to control multiple messages simultaneously.\n\nHere are some key features of &quot;ESET Smart Security&quot;:\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Integrated firewall and antispam module\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Improved graphical user interface\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· 2 operating modes for common and advanced users\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Improved and automatised cleaning\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· True incremental updates\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Export / import settings\n\n\n*** ATTENTION ***\n                                                            \n\n*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*\nx ALL my uploads scanned by Kaspersky Anti-Virus x                            \n*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*\n                                                                      \n*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*\nx They WON'T be here if they never pass x                                 \n*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*                                                         \n\n***&gt; Check out for more of my uploads @ \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/kentucky-kid/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/kentucky-kid/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^^*^*^*^*\nAfter your download, please DON'T forget to seed so that you can help others get this torrent &amp; feel free to leave any comments.                                                                            \n^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^^*^*^*^*^*^*\n\nShould you need anything, feel free to approach me on SuprBay(The Pirate Bay Forum) here: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=77652&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=77652&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCheers! \n\nRegards,\nkentucky-kid :]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15335d07c9d73020ebc883a9381421ce4397db3c","amp;dn":"Eset+Nod32+Smart+Secuirty+v4.0%2BNod+Enabler+v3.0+%5B+kk+%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15335d07c9d73020ebc883a9381421ce4397db3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,51,93,7,201,215,48,32,235,200,131,169,56,20,33,206,67,151,219,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
