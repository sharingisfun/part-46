HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not surprised when fellow Sidewinder Nick OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Flaherty stays with him in New Orleans. Nor is he surprised when Nick travels home with him to help him get back on his feetÃ¢â‚¬â€after all, years on the same Marine Force Recon team bonded the men in ways that only bleeding for a brother can. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very surprised, though, when Nick humors his moment of curiosity and kisses him.\n\nNick knows all of KellyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quirks and caprices, so the kiss was a low-risk move on his part . . . or so he thought. But what shouldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been a simple moment unleashes a flood of confusing emotions and urges that neither man is prepared to address.\n\nNow, Kelly and Nick must figure out what they mean to each otherÃ¢â‚¬â€friends and brothers in arms, or something even deeper?Ã¢â‚¬â€before the past can come back to ruin their tenuous future.\nGenre: MM Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc27b6437d4630f979bef1b7ad2aaf766f6af8b6","amp;dn":"Abigail+Roux+-+Shock+%26amp%3B+Awe.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc27b6437d4630f979bef1b7ad2aaf766f6af8b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,39,182,67,125,70,48,249,121,190,241,183,173,42,175,118,111,106,248,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
