It breathes life into gargoyles, which terrorize not only the area but also passing allied bombers. Operating from Kent, first an RAF squad and then a USAF squad sent to rescue them suffer heavy losses. Crash survivors combine, advised by local resistance and legend, in a desperate fight against the hell-breed, with rebellious ace pilot Will in the ultimate star part.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0027b001aebf8ee78d35d6566aa0feed13a40c8","amp;dn":"Reign+of+the+Gargoyles+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0027b001aebf8ee78d35d6566aa0feed13a40c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,2,123,0,26,235,248,238,120,211,93,101,102,170,15,238,209,58,64,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
