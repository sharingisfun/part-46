The people of the Kansas town first menaced by the little, furry creatures find that they are not yet safe as they are again assaulted when the creatures reproduce. Charlie (Don Opper) is joined by Lee (Roxanne Kernohan) as all join forces to save the town. The special effects, particularly the &quot;&quot;critters&quot; are again, superb, but the direction by Mick Garris is less self-assured than in the original feature. While still enjoyable, Critters 2 is not nearly as much fun as the original, but still well worth a view.\n\n\n                                Mpaa Rating++++++++++\n\n                         N/A\n\n\n                                Retail Release Date++++++++\n\n                                    29 APRIL 1988\n\n                                DVD Content++++++++++\n\n                             \n                 Main Movie+++++++++++++++\n\t              +Video- CCE Encoded - 5 passes\n\t              +Audio-English\n                          +Subs-English\n\n\n                 Menu+++++++\n\t              +Yes\t\n              \n                 Extras/Special Features+++++\n\t              +Yes\n\n                 Removed++++++++++++++\n\t              FBI crap and trailers and all of the other annoying and useless stuff.\n\n\n\n                 Chapters++++++++++++++\n\n\nUploader Info ***: Thank you for choosing my release from others that are available on the internet already.
