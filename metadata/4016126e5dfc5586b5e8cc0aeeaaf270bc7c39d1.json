When his mutilated corpse is found in a drifting dinghy, ripples of horror spread among his bizarre neighbours on the remote Suffolk coast: the cruel and cynical drama critic, the celebrated recluse, the rakish young heir, the terrified woman waiting for her killer in a lonely house... It is up to Superintendent Adam Dalgliesh and his extraordinary aunt to discover the shocking truth about Seton's past - before the plot takes another murderous turn.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4016126e5dfc5586b5e8cc0aeeaaf270bc7c39d1","amp;dn":"Unnatural+Causes+-+P+D+James++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4016126e5dfc5586b5e8cc0aeeaaf270bc7c39d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,22,18,110,93,252,85,134,181,232,204,10,238,170,242,112,188,124,57,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
