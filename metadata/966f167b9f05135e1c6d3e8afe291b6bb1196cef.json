Traditionally, the goal of psychology has been to relieve human suffering, but the goal of the Positive Psychology movement, which Dr. Seligman has led for fifteen years, is differentÃ¢â‚¬â€itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about actually raising the bar for the human condition.\n\nFlourish builds on Dr. SeligmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s game-changing work on optimism, motivation, and character to show how to get the most out of life, unveiling an electrifying new theory of what makes a good lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€for individuals, for communities, and for nations. In a fascinating evolution of thought and practice, Flourish refines what Positive Psychology is all about.\n\nWhile certainly a part of well-being, happiness alone doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t give life meaning. Seligman now asks, What is it that enables you to cultivate your talents, to build deep, lasting relationships with others, to feel pleasure, and to contribute meaningfully to the world? In a word, what is it that allows you to flourish? Ã¢â‚¬Å“Well-beingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ takes the stage front and center, and Happiness (or Positive Emotion) becomes one of the five pillars of Positive Psychology, along with Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and AccomplishmentÃ¢â‚¬â€or PERMA, the permanent building blocks for a life of profound fulfillment.\n\nThought-provoking in its implications for education, economics, therapy, medicine, and public policyÃ¢â‚¬â€the very fabric of societyÃ¢â‚¬â€Flourish tells inspiring stories of Positive Psychology in action, including how the entire U.S. Army is now trained in emotional resilience; how innovative schools can educate for fulfillment in life and not just for workplace success; and how corporations can improve performance at the same time as they raise employee well-being.\n\nWith interactive exercises to help readers explore their own attitudes and aims, Flourish is a watershed in the understanding of happiness as well as a tool for getting the most out of life. On the cutting edge of a science that has changed millions of lives, Dr. Seligman now creates the ultimate extension and capstone of his bestselling classics, Authentic Happiness and Learned Optimism.\n\nSupplemental PDF of text, tables, and graphs included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:966f167b9f05135e1c6d3e8afe291b6bb1196cef","amp;dn":"Flourish","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"966f167b9f05135e1c6d3e8afe291b6bb1196cef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,111,22,123,159,5,19,94,28,109,62,138,254,41,27,107,177,25,108,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
