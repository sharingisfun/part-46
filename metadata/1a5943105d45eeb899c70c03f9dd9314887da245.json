Long influenced by the Chicago blues, the band \n\npaid a visit to Muddy WatersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ club the Checkerboard Lounge to see the \n\nlegendary bluesman perform. It didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take long before Mick Jagger, \n\nKeith Richards, Ronnie Wood and Ian Stewart were joining in on stage \n\nand later Buddy Guy and Lefty Dizz also played their part. It was a \n\nunique occasion that was fortunately captured on camera. Now, \n\nrestored from the original footage and with sound mixed and mastered \n\nby Bob Clearmountain, this amazing blues night is being made \n\navailable in an official release for the first time.\n\n\nfeature length 1:36:11, plus bonus videos 5:23 &amp; 3:31\n29.97fps, 640x480 (4:3 AR)\naac audio @ 160kb/s\navc x264 video @ 1395kb/s (average)\n\n\noriginal video quality is not that great, but hey! that is not what \n\nthis is about.
