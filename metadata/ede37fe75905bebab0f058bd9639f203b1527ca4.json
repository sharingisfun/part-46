Its graphics replaced skeuomorphism with flat graphic design and blurred translucency effects, following the aesthetic introduced with iOS 7. Some icons have been changed to correspond with those of iOS 7 and iOS 8. Yosemite maintains the OS X desktop metaphor.\n\nOther design changes include new icons, light and dark color schemes, and the replacement of Lucida Grande with Helvetica Neue as the default system typeface. The Dock is now a 2D translucent rectangle instead of a skeuomorphic glass shelf, reminiscent of the Dock design used in early versions of OS X through Tiger and in iOS since iOS 7.\n\nSystem requirements\nMost Macintosh products capable of running OS X Mountain Lion (v10.8.x) are supported by Yosemite; all models capable of running OS X Mavericks (v10.9.x) are able to run Yosemite since they have the same requirements. However, in order to take full advantage of the Handoff feature, additional minimum system requirements include a Mac with Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0). As with Mavericks and Mountain Lion, 2 GB of RAM, 8 GB of available storage, and OS X 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard) or later are required.\n\n\nThis is an untouched installer image which works on QEMU/KVM and or Virtualbox only FakeSMC.kext has been added in order to boot the image.\n\n\nuse Champlist to enable ethernetbuiltin=y and generate an SMbios.plist into /Extra &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tools.inmac.org/Champlist.zip&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tools.inmac.org/Champlist.zip&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n1ApgDD1NuCce9JoHpyPnScPS25Kx4wbAZ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ede37fe75905bebab0f058bd9639f203b1527ca4","amp;dn":"Mac+OS+X+Yosemite+10.10.3+QEMU%2FKVM+%2F+Virtualbox+Install+Image","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ede37fe75905bebab0f058bd9639f203b1527ca4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,227,127,231,89,5,190,186,176,240,88,189,150,57,242,3,177,82,124,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
