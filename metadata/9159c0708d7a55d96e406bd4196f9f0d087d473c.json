Miller and Shah captured the lives of three Palestinian children growing up in the bullet-riddled streets of Gaza. They had also planned to film the lives of Israeli children but, in the midst of production, Miller was shot to death by an Israeli tank, falling victim to the very conflict he covered. \n\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 700 MiB for 1h 20mn 53s 88ms\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 073 Kbps\nAspect            : 448 x 336 (1.333) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 128 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9159c0708d7a55d96e406bd4196f9f0d087d473c","amp;dn":"Death+in+Gaza_HBO+Documentary_PDTV_XviD%7EEkolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9159c0708d7a55d96e406bd4196f9f0d087d473c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,89,192,112,141,122,85,217,110,64,107,212,25,111,159,13,8,125,71,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
