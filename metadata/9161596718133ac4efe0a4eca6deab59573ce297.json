The powers that be do not seem to care about the people they claim responsibility for or feed their wealth. Nature is raped. People are mislead. Constantly pounding into us with a sense of uncontrollable greed. Crisis after crisis, year after year, day after dayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Chaos unleashed on humanity to create new order and give a false sense of security in a world that is slowly turned into a prison. Semi-fascist laws are passed under the veil of terrorism and world peace to legally control what needs to be controlled: the power of the people. This world is turning into a battlegroundÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦in many ways. People are pushed to survival in world that is structurally getting more grim and vicious. Where will this end? What does all of this mean? The signs of times to come. The writings on the wall.
