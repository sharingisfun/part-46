It may be sufficient for beginners, but once you get a shade more familiar with it, you'll probably notice soon that a lot of things are missing. Things like copilot support, holdings, missed approaches, departure and arrival procedures (SIDs/STARs)...\n\nFlying online is better, but here you'll be on your own once there is no controller in charge for a certain frequency - and our experience is, that many frequencies are not supervised during a flight. There must be a better way...\n\nPRO-ATC/X replaces Air Traffic Control in FSX in an impressive manner. The implemented Flight Planner is able to calculate a whole route simply by defining departure and destination airports while editing a calculated route is still possible. PRO-ATC/X is designed to control aircraft flying under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). So if you prefer &quot;The Big Ones&quot;, you are for sure surfing on the right site.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d4ba95a152448d6ba18c28e0ca59bf96e87281c","amp;dn":"FSX%2FP3D+Pointsoft+PRO-ATC%2FX+%28NOT+CRACKED%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d4ba95a152448d6ba18c28e0ca59bf96e87281c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,75,169,90,21,36,72,214,186,24,194,142,12,165,155,249,110,135,40,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
