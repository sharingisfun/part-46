Begley's first novel, Wartime Lies, was based on his childhood as a Polish Jew who escaped the Nazi death camps. It won the Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award in 1991 and the Prix MÃƒÂ©dicis ÃƒÂ©tranger in 1992. \n\nBegley's 1996 novel About Schmidt was basis for the eponymous 2002 film by Alexander Payne. Payne made many changes from the book, though Begley commented in an essay in The New York Times that &quot;my most important themes were treated with great intelligence and sensitivity&quot; and felt the movie was &quot;a gem of original filmmaking.&quot; His novels have been translated into fifteen languages.\n\nProustian in their attachment to the past, his novels demonstrate a robust knowledge of the world as it is. Their absorption in the mechanics of high-level financeÃ¢â‚¬â€stock options, trusts, sharing-of-proceeds agreementsÃ¢â‚¬â€reminds me of Balzac. Begley's long experience as a working lawyer has served him well in his new career; among other things, About Schmidt is an engaging treatise on how to avoid estate taxes.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following books, and all are in ePUB format:\n\n* Schmidt\n\n  - About Schmidt \n\n  - Schmidt Delivered\n\n  - Schmidt Steps Back\n\n* As Max Saw It\n\n* Matters of Honor\n\n* Memories of a Marriage\n\n* The Man Who Was Late\n\n* Wartime Lies\n \n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Begley&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Begley&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.louisbegley.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.louisbegley.com&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/392/the-art-of-fiction-no-172-louis-begley&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/392/the-art-of-fiction-no-172-louis-begley&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddfacccc443ca239202ada559306ffbcf1378d15","amp;dn":"Louis+Begley+-+About+Schmidt+%26amp%3B+Other+Works+%288+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddfacccc443ca239202ada559306ffbcf1378d15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,250,204,204,68,60,162,57,32,42,218,85,147,6,255,188,241,55,141,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
