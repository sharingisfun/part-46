Filmed in 100 locations around the country, covering everything from Quaker to Shaker, George Washington to Bierstadt, Remington to Warhol, and the skyscrapers of New York City, Hughes has applied his considerable wit and imagination to the problem of revealing how art records and preserves both points of view and ways of life. It is American history told through art, not merely a history of art. It offers a perspective that is refreshingly elevating and inclusive. With the same voracious wit and opinionated brilliance that have characterized his criticism for Time magazine, this tour-de-force spans three centuries of events, movements, and personalities that have shaped American society and its art.\n\n\n1)  The Republic of Virtue \nRobert Hughes charts the foundation of a national identity that sought architectural inspiration from Greece and Rome. He also looks at America's earliest major painters.\n\n2)  The Promised Land \nRobert Hughes explains how America was shaped by Europeans - Spaniards in the south west, Pilgrims in the north east and struggling cavaliers in Virginia - who saw the New World as both paradise and hell.\n\n3)  The Wilderness and the West \nArt critic Robert Hughes looks at America's majestic landscapes, exploring how artists have contributed to the religious and patriotic connotations of nature.\n\n4)  The Gilded Age \nRobert Hughes considers how the Civil War industrialised society, bringing steam power, the Brooklyn Bridge, plutocrats and an urban underclass. Nostalgia for loss entered the culture and brought the Museum Age.\n\n5)  The Wave from the Atlantic \nMass immigration at the turn of the century confirmed America as a multicultural society, but also brought increased poverty and slum life. Robert Hughes examines how this was often reflected in art.\n\n6)  Streamlines and Breadlines \nRobert Hughes considers America during the 1920s and 30s, including the skyscraper as the image of modernism, the Depression, regionalist art and black art.\n\n7)  The Empire of Signs \nRobert Hughes examines America's development into the art capital of the West between 1945 and the late 1960s, with the advent of abstract expressionism and pop art.\n\n8)  The Age of Anxiety \nRobert Hughes focuses on work that responded to the Vietnam War and civil strife. He traces the development of minimalism and ends up on top of an extinct volcano.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img46.imageshack.us/img46/1525/lm9y.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img46.imageshack.us/img46/1525/lm9y.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/1721/8oom.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/1721/8oom.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img17.imageshack.us/img17/1524/6eqm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img17.imageshack.us/img17/1524/6eqm.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img407.imageshack.us/img407/5929/59sr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img407.imageshack.us/img407/5929/59sr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img27.imageshack.us/img27/1503/qw55.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img27.imageshack.us/img27/1503/qw55.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img199.imageshack.us/img199/2884/twcn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img199.imageshack.us/img199/2884/twcn.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img199.imageshack.us/img199/7686/yyo1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img199.imageshack.us/img199/7686/yyo1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img22.imageshack.us/img22/3263/tgfy.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img22.imageshack.us/img22/3263/tgfy.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img818.imageshack.us/img818/8537/uvn8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img818.imageshack.us/img818/8537/uvn8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;87cae6eee9c7cbb4a9b7&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 1750 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.333 (4:3)\n * Video: Resolution: 720 x 480\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 45mins\n * Framerate: 29fps\n * Number of Parts: 8\n * Part Size: 674 MB\n * Container: Mp4\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Thanks to &quot;llamabert&quot;\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.artcyclopedia.com/robert_hughes.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.artcyclopedia.com/robert_hughes.html&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0a49dd1d2516b6937bcde0af3e781900982b4b3","amp;dn":"American+Visions+4of8+The+Gilded+Age+PDTV+x264+AAC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0a49dd1d2516b6937bcde0af3e781900982b4b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,164,157,209,210,81,107,105,55,188,222,10,243,231,129,144,9,130,180,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
