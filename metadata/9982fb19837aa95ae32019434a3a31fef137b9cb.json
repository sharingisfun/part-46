Now he wants to find out the truth about the most popular illegal drug in Britain, see the lengths people will go to get it and discover exactly where it comes from.\n\nEpisode 1 of 2\nIn the first of two programmes, James looks at the effects of the drug on the streets of Britain, meeting a 17-year-old who smokes weed with his parents and a mum-of-three who uses cannabis to keep her emotions in check. He meets people who are growing cannabis illegally for themselves and goes out on patrol with a police drug squad as they clamp down on large-scale cannabis growers. He also travels to California, the first state in America to license cannabis for medicinal use.\n\nEpisode 2 of 2\nIn the second episode, James explores the hidden world of organised crime linked to the supply of cannabis in the UK, following a police drug squad and the UK Border Agency as they target gangs and smugglers. He meets the casualties of the drugs trade, including a 14-year-old addict who has convictions for burglary to fund his habit and a Vietnamese teenager smuggled into Britain by lorry to work in British cannabis farms to supply the huge demand.\n\n\nCheck this account for updates regularly :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9982fb19837aa95ae32019434a3a31fef137b9cb","amp;dn":"Cannabis+Collection+-+BBC+-+Cannabis+-+Whats+the+Harm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9982fb19837aa95ae32019434a3a31fef137b9cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,130,251,25,131,122,169,90,227,32,25,67,74,58,49,254,241,55,185,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
