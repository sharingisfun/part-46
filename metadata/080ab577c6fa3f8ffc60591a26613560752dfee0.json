That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.\n       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those &quot;Pre-DC&quot; comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some &quot;Post DC&quot; comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c.875-885gb in total. It will take as long as it takes.  I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.\n\n================================\n\n\n    [color=red][b][We passed the estimated half way point in part 27. I just did not notice. So It's all down hill from here![/b][/color]\n\n     If you look in the introduction above I've revised the estimated total from c.800-850gb up to c.875-885gb. That should be a pretty solid estimate now since we've already done over half. With what I have right now, the total would be c.868gb. Add new scans and publications, remove duplicates and I'm guessing around 880gb.\n\n\n     I'm not usually given to fads, following fashions, or the like. This is without the SLIGHTEST thought of being some kind of elitist &quot;hipster&quot; -  a foolish self-deluded ilk with whom I want little to do - and that's being generous But since a certain site  was one of my favorite time-wasting destinations long before it started getting &quot;fashionable&quot;, I am allowing myself to get a bit caught up in it's moment of glory - and so I sayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.\n\n         Stay calm and Chive on!\n\n      Yes I said &quot;moment&quot; of glory. I think that bubble's about due to burst. That's the way of things. I think it is deeply encoded in the very nature of existence itself, carved in unchangeable cryptic symbols and dark incantations by the incredible power of the holy &quot;Big Bang&quot; itself  \n\tI'm not taking about that really great party you remember from college with that amazing person, persons, animal or what's its you never saw again - and believe me you are better off, and I'm definitely not talking about that really great party I remember with anyone or anything, because there wasn't one. Not once. I wasted my youth, and now it's too late. To be fair you can't waste opportunities you never had because you were such a nerd, so in the deeper sense, it always was to late.\n\tI am talking about the ultimate firecracker, the bigone,  the creation ex nihilo per nihil! (top that one God!) The very beginning of beginnings, the instant of instants, the first of firsts. Note there is really no point in shouting &quot;first!&quot; on forums guys, because you positively aren't.\n\tOh and no correcting my physics with some wacky string-theory-based eternal-oscillating-universes story. This stuff is far from a settled question and I stand by my nothing. \n\t \n\tNow, I have no life, as the comment attached to the torrent file you download for my torrents says in it's comment space. (To see the full comment/tag look for the option to view it in your torrent program.)\n\tIt's amazing how much time it takes  to live no life folks. I estimate that I spend 672-744 hours per month on that alone. Add in work, sleep, eating and the other essentials and sometimes I think I spend as much time living no life at all as the average person with a full life does. Of course those folks tend to spend as much as an awe inspiring 168 hours a week at it, which is pretty astonishing!\n\tAnyway I really need to get back to not living it or I'll have to stay up late to not do it.\n\n\tUntil next time If you see me in a switch, or on fiber highway, or even a dial-up back alley, feel free to say &quot;hi!&quot;. As always, I'll ignore you unless you are female. Then I can't help myself - it's a deep, primal evolutionarily critical urge that controls me then. That is to say -  women make me stammer and hide in terror. That goes without saying.\n\n=================================\n\n[b][color=lightskyblue]Today's offering: DC from La-Leg[/color][/b]\n\nNotably included  - the Legion of Super-Heroes! Everything starting with &quot;legion&quot; makes up over half this set.\n\n[color=red][b]Enjoy![/b][/color] \n\nA DCP Archive Edition Presents Dave Cockrum Tribute-The Legion Issues 167p H\n     Here for the sake of Cockram fans. Personally I really don't follow artists or writers in comics, which is odd since I do in books. On the other hand I compare it to a TV series where I pay no attention to writers or directors. \n\nL.A.W., The 01-06 (1999-2000)\nL.E.G.I.O.N 01-70 (1989-1994)\nL.E.G.I.O.N.
