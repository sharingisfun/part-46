He lived off the grid, avoiding the fallout from the bombs and the Burnout Fever that ravaged the world. With the occasional trespasser to keep his skills sharp, life was smooth and settled and exactly how he wanted it.\n\nAll that changed when three stragglers showed up that he didn't have the heart to turn away. Two children led by a shepherd who had lost her own way, Carl felt the sins of his past had finally come calling. Especially when it turned out the children had their own demons in pursuit.\n\nOn the run once again, they must survive the North American badlands, an enemy with unlimited resources, and each other. Ultimately it will come down to Carl to decide just how much he is willing to sacrifice for the safety of his charges.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dde028a8a0a268dcd6c617104cbb28f3fb9ee4a8","amp;dn":"Wanted+-+Jason+Halstead","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dde028a8a0a268dcd6c617104cbb28f3fb9ee4a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,224,40,168,160,162,104,220,214,198,23,16,76,187,40,243,251,158,228,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
