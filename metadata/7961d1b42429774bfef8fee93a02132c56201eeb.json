The history of God cannot possibly be told. How can you write the history of One who is outside time and space, and who has no beginning and no end? Nevertheless, the desire to understand and experience the divine is a fundamental human need. For billions of people, through many millennia, the quest to answer the basic questions of existence -- Why are we born? What will happen to us when we die? and how should we live out lives? -- has become a search for God. A Brief History of God explores the myriad ways in which humans have sought connection to the divine from the dawn of history to the present -- not just through religion and philosophy, but in art and literature, in music and dance, and in science.\r\nAmazon","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7961d1b42429774bfef8fee93a02132c56201eeb","amp;dn":"God+-+A+brief+history+%28DK+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7961d1b42429774bfef8fee93a02132c56201eeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,97,209,180,36,41,119,75,254,248,254,233,58,2,19,44,86,32,30,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
