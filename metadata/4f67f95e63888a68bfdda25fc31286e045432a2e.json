Global enterprises benefit from faster computers through regular, automated, unattended defragmentation with PerfectDisk.\n\nCertified by Microsoft for Windows, PerfectDisk is designed for today's largest disk drives. With the PerfectDisks Command Center management console, complete management and control is at the administrator's fingertips. If you really need disk defragmentation, optimization, as well as free space consolidation, then PerfectDisk will surely meet each of your high demands and precise necessities.\n\nDesigned to quickly and efficiently defragment heavily fragmented, multi-terabyte drives\n\nPerfectDisk will defragment your largest drives faster and more efficiently than any other product, resulting in faster-performing PCs, laptops and servers and a more productive user experience. And you don't need to be concerned about the size of the drive or how badly fragmented it is - PerfectDisk can handle it. PerfectDisk will make your drive completely defragmented and optimized..Plus, you won't pay a premium to defragment large drives. And that saves you money.\n\nSMARTPlacement -- patented file placement strategy\n\nPerfectDisk's SMARTPlacementÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â·Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â·Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â·Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â·Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â·Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â·Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â·ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ optimization strategy results in faster subsequent defragmentation runs because many of the files on the drive do not need to be moved at all, since they are placed according to users unique usage patterns. Typical defragmenters waste resources by constantly moving all files around on the drive.\n\nSpace Restoration Technology\n\nSpace Restoration Technology provides the most complete and efficeient free space consolidation available today. Raxco Software pioneereed free space consolidation years ago, and the leadership continues with PerfectDisk 8. Added to PerfectDisk's unique single-pass free space consolidation is another exclusive -- Consolidate Free Space Defrag. Consolidate Free Space Defrag creates the largest piece of contiguous free space available. This is useful prior to creating large files or in performing partition resizing operations. It is also useful in compressing a virtual hard drive on a virtual machine, as a large amount of contiguous space will be recaptured.\n\nAutoPilot Scheduling\n\nPerfectDisk's exclusive AutoPilot Scheduling automates all aspects of defragmentation. Administrators and users have complete flexibility in defining schedules to completely automate the enterprise's defragmentation. If users are working, PerfectDisk will run in the background. Once PerfectDisk's schedules are set, everything runs on autopilot.\n\nResource Saver -- patent-pending technology\n\nPerfectDisk's Resource Saver technology speeds up the process of file analysis, resulting in faster defragmentation runs. And it does it all using fewer resources than typical defragmenters.\n\nSingle pass file and free space defragmentation\n\nPerfectDisk does its job - thorough and complete file defragmentation and free space consolidation - in a single pass, no matter how large the drive or how badly fragmented the drive. No slowly chipping away at the problem like typical defragmenters. Once and done - and using fewer resources as well.\n\nIntelligent Screen Saver mode (Professional version only)\n\nPerfectDisk's Screen Saver mode will defragment when a system is idle, but only when the drive has not been defragmented in a user-defined number of days. While taking advantage of a PC or laptop being idle, it does not unnecessarily perform a defrag if one has recently been completed, thereby saving resources. Typical defragmenters do not have this intelligence built into their screen saver functionality.\n\nDefragments drives with as little as 5% free space\n\nPerfectDisk only requires the drive to have at least 5% free space. Other defragmenters require as much as 20% free space, thereby wasting space because much of the drive can't be used. Because PerfectDisk requires only 5% of the drive to be free space, you make much better use of your storage investments.\n\nPerfect-Time user-defined thresholds for defragmentation\n\nAllows you to limit the amount of times PerfectDisk needs to run to only when a chosen level of fragmentation is reached, thereby reducing unnecessary runs.\n\nFaster subsequent defragmentation runs\n\nFewer resources are consumed in subsequent defragmentation runs because of PerfectDisk's patented SMARTPlacement optimization strategy. This means you can do more, and do it faster.\n\nDefragments Master File Table (MFT) and all NTFS metadata\n\nBecause only PerfectDisk exclusively defragments all metadata, you end up with a drive that is completely defragmented. Other defragmenters do not defragment all of the NTFS metadata and even more alarming, do not report on the files they leave fragmented.\n\nDetailed fragmentation statistics for ALL files\n\nYou get the complete picture of the state of your drive. With other defragmenters, since you don't have statistics on all files, you're only seeing part of the picture.\n\nPlaces Master File Table (MFT) according to Microsoft recommendations for improved performance\n\nYou will see a 5%-10% performance improvement over other defragmenters because of where PerfectDisk places the MFT. Microsoft has specific guidelines for placement of the MFT for this improved performance, and only PerfectDisk follows these guidelines.\n\nSingle File Defrag\n\nPerfectDisk allows users to defragment a single file rather than an entire drive if desired. This can be useful for users working with large files, such as videos.\n\nDefragments directories, the pagefile and the hibernate file\n\nNo file or directory is left fragmented, so you'll have better performance.\n\nUtilizes the Microsoft move file Application Program Interface (API)\n\nEnsures complete safety of your system\n\nCPU and I/O throttling\n\nPerfectDisk provides the ability to control CPU and I/O resources. While PerfectDisk uses very little CPU resources, administrators still have the ability to throttle CPU depending on certain circumstances. Similarly, I/O activity can also be throttled. This can be useful if, for example, another application is performing large amounts of I/O.\n\nPower Management\n\nUsers can choose to control whether PerfectDisk should perform a scheduled defrag when the computer is running on a battery or connected to a UPS. This is particularly useful for laptops users, preventing the battery from being used.\n\nFull integration with Active Directory Group Policy Administrative Templates for enterprise deployment, scheduling, and management\n\nSaves time with enterprise deployment and requires no training for administrators familiar with Microsoft's Active Directory\n\nInstallation without User Interface for administrative control\n\nAllows administrators complete control if they wish to deny end users access to the PerfectDisk interface\n\nNo limitation of number of systems being scheduled\n\nEasy to schedule across the network, no matter how big. Some defragmenters place restrictions on how many systems can be scheduled.\n\nAutoUpdate Ability\n\nAutomatically keeps up with PerfectDisk updates to ensure you are always running the current release.\n\nFull-featured command line support for both local and remote operations\n\nNot limited to certain commands, as you are with other defragmenters. This ability to utilize all PerfectDisk commands gives you even more ability to control PerfectDisk and tailor according to your specific requirements.\n\nLow system resource (CPU, memory) usage\n\nSaves computer resources, freeing them for other needs and applications.\n\nAutomates compaction/defragmentation of Microsoft Exchange data stores\n\nImproves Exchange performance and helps you regain disk space (requires PerfectDisk for Exchange)\n\nPerfectDisk Client:\n\nUser Interface: PerfectDisk offers Fluent User Interface, a user interface that makes it easier for users to work so that they can deliver better results faster. The PerfectDisk interface is streamlined and has uncluttered workspace that minimizes distraction. This enables users to achieve the results they want more quickly and easily. The new interface has a Ribbon that presents commands organized into a set of tabs. The tabs on the Ribbon display the commands that are most relevant for each of the task areas in the applications.\n\nStealthPatrol Automatic Disk Defragmentation: Automatic defragmentation can be performed using PerfectDisk's exclusive StealthPatrol technology to optimize your drive only when your system is idle. StealthPatrol provides you the flexibility to run defragmentation passes when Windows is not busy and/or when user specified applications are not running. This feature ensures that when a specified application is running and the defragmentation pass is about to start or running, you do not lose performance for that application.\n\nPerfectDisk for VMWare: With PerfectDisk for VMWare, PerfectDisk can defragment, re-index and shrink VMWare virtual drives so that your VMware virtual machines perform the best possible.\n\nReclaim Free Space: The Reclaim Free Space feature of PerfectDisk detects and removes duplicate files such as text documents, pictures, music, and videos. It also purges the Recycle bin and removes temporary files, ensuring that your drive remains clutter free.\n\nSelect File(s) Defragmentation: With PerfectDisk you can quickly and easily defragment one or more specified files without having to defragment the entire drive.\n\nPerfectDisk Reports: Many new reports such as free space fragmentation report, file fragmentation report, etc. have been added and already existing performance reports, summary reports, etc. are now so much improved with graphics which gives you more visual understanding of your machine's data.\n\nInstallation and Upgrade: Licensing PerfectDisk has been made easier. PerfectDisk now accepts license keys to easily convert your evaluation version of PerfectDisk to a licensed version. Simply purchase a PerfectDisk license key and enter to continue running PerfectDisk without interruption.\n\nPerfectDisk Tray Icon: The PerfectDisk systray icon now allows initiating defragmentation on drives as well as stopping defragmentation.\n\nImproved Performance: PerfectDisk uses less system resources than previous versions. Performance when defragmenting very large drives is improved.\n\nSupport for Exchange 2007: PerfectDisk supports Exchange 2007, which runs on x64 edition of Windows Server.\n\nActive Directory Integration: PerfectDisk is fully integrated with Microsoft's Active Directory and now it is enhanced to deploy PerfectDisk with Active Directory by using the PerfectDisk Application.\n\nRequirements:\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· 32-bit, x64 and Itanium platforms\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· 64 MB RAM (128MB recommended)\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· 20 MB Disk Space\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· FAT16, FAT32 and NTFS\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· All levels of RAID and SAN are supported\n\n***************************************************************************\nDeveloper: Raxco Software\n\nSize/Supported OS: 48.6 MB / Windows All \n\nLast Updated On: October 22nd, 2009, 09:36 GMT\n\n[Description taken from http://www.softpedia.com/]\n\nxoxoxoxoxox\nx N O T E x\nxoxoxoxoxox\n\n1.
