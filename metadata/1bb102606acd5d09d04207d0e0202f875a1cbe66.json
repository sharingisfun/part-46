His novel, Emile: or, On Education, which he considered his most important work, is a seminal treatise on the education of the whole person for citizenship. His sentimental novel, Julie, ou la nouvelle HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©loÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯se, was of great importance to the development of pre-Romanticism[1] and romanticism in fiction.[2] Rousseau's autobiographical writings: his Confessions, which initiated the modern autobiography, and his Reveries of a Solitary Walker (along with the works of Lessing and Goethe in Germany, and Richardson and Sterne in England), were among the pre-eminent examples of the late eighteenth-century movement known as the &quot;Age of Sensibility&quot;, featuring an increasing focus on subjectivity and introspection that has characterized the modern age. Rousseau also wrote a play and two operas, and made important contributions to music as a theorist. During the period of the French Revolution, Rousseau was the most popular of the philosophes among members of the Jacobin Club. He was interred as a national hero in the PanthÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©on in Paris, in 1794, sixteen years after his death.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bb102606acd5d09d04207d0e0202f875a1cbe66","amp;dn":"Paul+Strathern+-+Rousseau+in+90+minutes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bb102606acd5d09d04207d0e0202f875a1cbe66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,177,2,96,106,205,93,9,208,66,7,208,224,32,47,135,90,28,190,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
