Not only does he own in Walsingford Hall one of the least attractive stately homes in the country, but he has to take in paying guests to keep it upright. So when it seems a rich (if not very nice) continental princess might buy it, he's overjoyed - particularly as he's being rooked by the publisher of his sporting memoirs. His daughter Jane comes up trumps in the company of the playwright Joe - but not before engagements are broken and fortunes lost and made. In a sunny story which involves chorus-girls, the theatre and a ball at the castle during a two-week house-party, Wodehouse deftly unties all the knots which he had so cleverly tied around his characters in the first place. --This text refers to the Paperback  edition.\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\nThe author of almost a hundred books and the creator of Jeeves, Blandings Castle, Psmith, Ukridge, Uncle Fred and Mr Mulliner, P.G. Wodehouse was born in 1881 and educated at Dulwich College. After two years with the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank he became a full-time writer, contributing to a variety of periodicals. As well as his novels and short stories, he wrote lyrics for musical comedies, and at one stage had five shows running simultaneously on Broadway. At the age of 93, in the New Year's Honours List of 1975, he received a long-overdue Knighthood, only to die on St Valentine's Day some 45 days later.\n\nAbout the Reader (from the uploader)\nBest reader for any book PG Wodehouse wrote!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:708a64f7ce84f5e387cf050c9d60070e3ed9e923","amp;dn":"PG+Wodehouse+%281938%29+-+Summer+Moonshine+-+Read+by+Jonathan+Cecil","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"708a64f7ce84f5e387cf050c9d60070e3ed9e923","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,138,100,247,206,132,245,227,135,207,5,12,157,96,7,14,62,217,233,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
