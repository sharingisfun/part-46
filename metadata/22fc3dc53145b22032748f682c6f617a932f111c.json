It was written by Katy Perry, Desmond Child and Andreas Carlsson. It is produced by Greg Wells (Mika, OneRepublic, Deftones) and co-produced by Perry. Wells is credited with playing all the instruments on the song. It was officially released to US radio stations on April 21, 2009.\n\n  The song debuted on the UK Singles Chart at 107 following her performance on Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway. It has so far peaked at #43 on the UK Singles Chart. It debuted at #65 on the Billboard Hot 100 becoming her biggest debut.

It is one of three tracks from the album written solely by Perry and the first single since Ur So Gay to be produced by another producer (Butch Walker).\n\n   besides Dr. Luke. Perry performed the song as the official single of her hit album, One of the Boys for the first time on MuchMusic HQ's MuchOnDemand on December 15, 2008.\n\n   &quot;Thinking of You&quot; also features on the compliation CD's Now 72 and Now 30 of the UK and US respectively. The song appears on the international soundtrack to the Brazilian telenovela Caminho das ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½ndias.\n\n     The first music video was released in 2007 and surfaced onto YouTube in May 2008 but has since been removed from the site. The video includes multiple rooms, including a white room with Perry that suggests violence (e.g., red wine), a dark room with an unhappy Perry in an unsatisfactory relationship, and a cloudy location. The video uses a cross-cutting technique that compares the two relationships: one with Perry reminiscing and another showing regret. The video ends with the revelation that Perry literally stabbed a man in the back in the white room.\n\n     The Second version is presented as a flashback montage with a young woman (played by Perry) whose lover is killed in France during the Second World War. It features actor Matt Dallas as Perry's true love and model Anderson Davis as Perry's second lover in the video.\n\n\n             =========================================================\n\n                    ***Thinking of You.(Second Version)(HQ).***\n\n                      ***Waking Up in Vegas.(Full&amp;Clean).***\n\n                                       Enjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22fc3dc53145b22032748f682c6f617a932f111c","amp;dn":"Katy+Perry-Waking+Up+In+Vegas%2CThinking+Of+You%28HQ%29-Wushan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22fc3dc53145b22032748f682c6f617a932f111c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,252,61,197,49,69,178,32,50,116,143,104,44,111,97,122,147,47,17,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
