In its single year of operation, two dozen people have died there. The locals say it's cursed. The Rangers say that's nonsense, but they know a man who might be willing to investigate. Horatio Korman crosses the water from the mainland, and hopes for the best.\n\nThe Nun\n\nBut the bodies pile up, and a hurricane is brewing up fast. One of the Jacaranda's guests sees time running out, so she seeks an authority of a different sort: a priest from El Huizache who is good at solving problems and keeping secrets. Eileen Callahan has a problem to solve, and a secret to keep. She crosses her fingers, and sends a message that could save them all.\n\nThe Padre\n\nJuan Miguel Quintero Rios broke a promise to the Virgin, and so he was punished...but his intentions were pure, so he was also blessed. Now he walks the southwest with second sight and a tattoo across his back: ''Deo, non Fortuna''--By God, not chance. The former gunslinger crosses himself, and makes for the Jacaranda Hotel.\n\nNovella takes place 20 years after the events of Fiddlehead, and will be unrelated to the main arc. \n\n\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fe23a6d43ed0c12955756d6544bec7bb9f9ccf5","amp;dn":"Cherie+Priest+-+Jacaranda+%28The+Clockwork+Century+%236%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fe23a6d43ed0c12955756d6544bec7bb9f9ccf5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,226,58,109,67,237,12,18,149,87,86,214,84,75,236,123,185,249,204,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
