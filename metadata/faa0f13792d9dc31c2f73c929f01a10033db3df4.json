When Kip married Vicky, he says he knew that her daughter, Tory, was part of the package. Now, he struggles to get along with the 17-year-old, and they often engage in jaw-dropping screaming matches followed by a month without speaking. Hear the scathing remarks that Dr. Phil describes as the most inappropriate comments that heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ever heard a parent say about a child. What led someone to fear for ToryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s safety and make a worried call to authorities? And, what, if any, ownership do this teen and her mother have in this family dynamic?
