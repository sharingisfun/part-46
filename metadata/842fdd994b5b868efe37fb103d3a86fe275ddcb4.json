Turn on your box, and OpenELEC is ready and waiting in less than 10 seconds - as fast as some DVD players. A simple remote control is all you will need. On top of that, one need not worry about updating OpenELEC, as the software will self-update automatically when connected to the Internet and an update is available. Installing OpenELEC takes less than 5 minutes and requires zero Linux experience. After that, one need merely add oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s media files and preferred addons, and OpenELEC will 'just work.' &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.openelec.tv/news/itemlist/category/21-downloads&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.openelec.tv/news/itemlist/category/21-downloads&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.openelec.tv/get-openelec&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.openelec.tv/get-openelec&lt;/a&gt; (others builds) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://openelec.tv/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://openelec.tv/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nmd5sum : 281fdfe9d3bce73d5dd7f6405fb7354d  OpenELEC-Generic.i386-1.0.0.tar.bz2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:842fdd994b5b868efe37fb103d3a86fe275ddcb4","amp;dn":"OpenELEC-Generic.i386-1.0.0.tar.bz2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"842fdd994b5b868efe37fb103d3a86fe275ddcb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,47,221,153,75,91,134,142,254,55,251,16,61,58,134,254,39,93,220,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
