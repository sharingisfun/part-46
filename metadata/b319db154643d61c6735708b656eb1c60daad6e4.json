The ear \n   behaves  as  if  it  contains  a  bank  of  filters,  each  filter  passing \n   frequencies within the  critical band. Two  tones separated by  more than a \n   critical bandwidth are received by  the ear independently. For this  reason \n   BARK contains a filter bank with 27 bandpass filters matching the  critical \n   bandwidth.  \n             \n   In fact, the human ear have also its own built in compression system  which \n   are  based  on  the  critical  bands.  Consequently  BARK  incorporates  an \n   independent compression algorithm for each of its 27 bands. \n             \n             \n   Features: \n             \n   The Multiband Filter \n             \n   - 27 Bark band Equalizer/Compressor \n   - Linear phase precision filters for maximal transparency \n   - +24 / -48 dB gain change rate per band \n   - Surround operation with channel link/unlink* \n   - Minimized latency ( 12 ms ) \n   - Real time pre/post processing spectrum display \n   - Compression parameters overall and per band. \n\n\n                                                          \n                         \n                                   \n                  \n                                        \n                  1) Unzip, Unrar and run Setup.exe \n                            \n                  2) Enjoy this fine Team AiR release !!! \n\n\n                       \n                                      \n               \n                                                    nFO bY ThE AiRBEARS 2009  \n\n   Unfortunately the vst2 and vst3 version of this plugin can't co-exist in C5\n   In this plugin the vst3 version takes priority over the vst2 version\n   delete the vst3 version from c:program filescommon filesVST3\n   restart Cubase 5 and the vst2 version will appear","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b319db154643d61c6735708b656eb1c60daad6e4","amp;dn":"VirSyn.Bark.VST.RTAS.v1.1.0-AiR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b319db154643d61c6735708b656eb1c60daad6e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,25,219,21,70,67,214,28,103,53,112,139,101,110,177,198,13,170,214,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
