Adopted into a well-connected family and educated at an exclusive school, she fell instantly and hopelessly in love with a charming and charismatic cartoonist in Amsterdam. Paul and Nikki embarked on a passionate love affair, enjoying the hedonistic days of the 1980s before eloping and returning to Australia. But soon Nikki found herself in a world she never imagined. Descending into the depths of the sex industryÃ¢â‚¬â€as a dominatrix, stripper, prostitute, and porn starÃ¢â‚¬â€there was almost nothing she didn't do. Despite a stormy marriage, she and Paul starred in and marketed their highly successful Horny Housewife X-rated videos as she became the queen of Australian erotica. Leading a double life as a mother of three small children, Nikki struggled not merely with censorship but with child welfare authorities and the judgement of mainstream society. In this extraordinary memoir, Nikki vividly recounts her intriguing past with emotional honesty and great insight, making it an unflinching and absorbing account of the incredible life of the Horny Housewife.\n\nEnglish | 2014 | ISBN: 174331339X | 352 pages | EPUB, MOBI | 3 MB \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b84e2807efdc94d65a39d2346479ae99e1455dc4","amp;dn":"%5BNikki_Stern%5DNot+Your+Ordinary+Housewife+How+the+Man+I+Loved+Led","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b84e2807efdc94d65a39d2346479ae99e1455dc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,78,40,7,239,220,148,214,90,57,210,52,100,121,174,153,225,69,93,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
