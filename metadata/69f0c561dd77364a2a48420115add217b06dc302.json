Described by one observer as the theatrical equivalent to a musical chamber work, this production stars Alan Bates, Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren and Laurence Olivier. Little is said, but much is implied, in this story of an unorthodox romantic triangle. Running 64 minutes, The Collection was coproduced by Olivier for Britain's Granada Television. It was one of six works selected by the eminent actor for his &quot;Best Plays of the Century&quot; series: others included Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Hindle Wakes, Come Back Little Sheba, Daphne Laureola and Saturday, Sunday, Monday.\n\nDirector:\nMichael Apted\nWriter:\nHarold Pinter (writer)\n\n\n\tLaurence Olivier\t... \tHarry\n\n\tAlan Bates\t... \tJames\n\n\tMalcolm McDowell\t... \tBill\n\n\tHelen Mirren\t... \tStella\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:03:22\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 704x576\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1355 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,14 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 192 Kbps\n\n\n\nENJOY  AND  SEED\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69f0c561dd77364a2a48420115add217b06dc302","amp;dn":"The+Collection+%281976%29+%28TV%29+Laurence+Olivier.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69f0c561dd77364a2a48420115add217b06dc302","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,240,197,97,221,119,54,74,42,72,66,1,21,173,210,23,176,109,195,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
