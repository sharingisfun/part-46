What do you do for the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“sweetcorn kidsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ who come out of the education system in pretty much the same state as when they went in? WhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the Real Point of School? Exams ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ So Whose Bright Idea Was That?

Which is the odd one out between a hamster and a caravan?\n\nWith his customary combination of hard-hitting truths, practical classroom ideas and irreverent sense of humour, Ian Gilbert takes the reader on a breathless rollercoaster ride through burning issues of the 21st century, considering everything from the threats facing the world and the challenge of the BRIC economies to the link between eugenics and the 11+.\n\nAs wide-ranging and exhaustively-researched as it is entertaining and accessible, this book is designed to challenge teachers and inform them - as well as encourage them ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ as they strive to design a 21st century learning experience that really does bring the best out of all young people. After all, the future of the world may just depend on it.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18efab0738403b88444ec0a819175c1530e92e58","amp;dn":"Why+Do+I+Need+a+Teacher+When+I%5C%27ve+got+Google%3F-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18efab0738403b88444ec0a819175c1530e92e58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,239,171,7,56,64,59,136,68,78,192,168,25,23,92,21,48,233,46,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
