Do you consider yourself a weekend warrior?\n\n  Then State of Mine's fast and melodic skatepunk might be a perfect fit for\n  you. Mostly influenced by the nineties Swedish skatepunk sound, and more\n  established bands as Belvedere, Lagwagon and Man(d)y M(o)ore, State of Mine\n  effectuated more than 75 shows on local and not-so-local stages in Belgium and\n  abroad since November 2007. These shows included support slots for bands as\n  SNFU (Can), Smoke or Fire (USA), Rentokill (Au), Mute (Can), High Five Drive\n  (Can), Pendleton (UK), The Living Daylights (UK), Jet Market (It) and other\n  massively talented, yet less known bands.\n\n  A first release followed after nearly a year of constant rehearsing and\n  performing. The DIY 'Geargrinder' EP sold out within the first months after\n  it's release in October 2008. After a major change in the SoM line up (one\n  guitar less, a replacement behind the drums and a new lead vocal), plans were\n  made for a split CD with The Octopussy's, to be released under Kickass Records\n  (the band's own D.I.Y. record label) by the end of April 2009.\n\n  After a rushy 2009 filled with playing shows and promoting the split CD in\n  Belgium, the band scheduled to start writing their debut full album\n  'Accelerate!' around the end of the year. It quickly got clear that the only\n  feasible option was to do the whole thing in a D.I.Y. fashion.\n  Slowly, but steadily, the recording sessions for 'Accelerate!' started off in\n  April 2010.\n\n  And now, at the start of 2011, the band is extremely proud to be able to\n  present the finished album.\n\n  Next to that the need for a second guitar player became quite acute going\n  through the recording process. Victor Navarro (ex-Struggling for reason)\n  happily filled the vacant spot. As a fivepiece, State of Mine guarantees an\n  energetic live show, spiced up with old and new skatepunk covers.\n\n- Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n  01.
