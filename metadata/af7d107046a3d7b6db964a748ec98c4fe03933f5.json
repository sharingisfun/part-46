Drawing on his own experiences as a fighter pilot, Dahl crafted these 10 spine-tingling stories: of air battles in the sky; of the nightmare of being shot down; of the infectious madness of conflict; and of the nervy jollity of the Mess and Ops room. Dahl brilliantly conveys the bizarre reality of a wartime pilot's daily existence, where death is a constant companion and life is lived from one heartbeat to the next.\n\n\nThe stories are:\n\nDeath of an Old Old Man,  read by Julian Rhind-Tutt\nAn African Story,  read by Cillian Murphy\nA Piece of Cake,  read by Julian Rhind-Tutt\nMadame Rosette,  read by Julian Rhind-Tutt\nKatina,  read by Cillian Murphy\nYesterday Was Beautiful,  read by Juliet Stevenson\nThey Shall Not Grow Old,  read by Cillian Murphy\nBeware of the Dog,  read by Cillian Murphy\nOnly This,  read by Sophie Okonedo\nSomeone Like You,  read by Julian Rhind-Tutt\n\n\n\nFile format:  mp3  (64 Kbps, 24 KHz, 2 Channels, Joint Stereo)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af7d107046a3d7b6db964a748ec98c4fe03933f5","amp;dn":"Roald+Dahl+-+Over+to+You","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af7d107046a3d7b6db964a748ec98c4fe03933f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,125,16,112,70,163,215,182,219,150,74,116,142,201,140,79,224,57,51,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
