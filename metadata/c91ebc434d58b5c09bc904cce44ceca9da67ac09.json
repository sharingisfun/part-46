Although much of her previous work was more country oriented, Beth Nielsen Chapman reveals more pop-minded sensibilities and she is backed by an array of top session players from Nashville and L.A. &quot;Life Holds On&quot; is a wide-eyed affirmation of life graced by Mark Casstevens mandolin playing. The scope of most of the album is more focused on relationships, and Chapman delivers songs like &quot;All I Have,&quot; &quot;Avalanche,&quot; and &quot;Down on My Knees&quot; with a beautiful, crystal-clear voice. Intelligent and mature, she is a gifted artist who comfortably fits alongside '70s singer/songwriters like Carole King and Carly Simon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c91ebc434d58b5c09bc904cce44ceca9da67ac09","amp;dn":"Beth+Nielsen+Chapman+-+Beth+Nielsen+Chapman+%5B1990%5D+%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c91ebc434d58b5c09bc904cce44ceca9da67ac09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,30,188,67,77,88,181,192,155,201,4,204,228,76,236,169,218,103,172,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
