They released four studio albums between 1992 and 2002, which sold over 30 million copies worldwide, making them the third-most successful band from Sweden of all time, after ABBA and Roxette.\r\n\r\nHappy Nation, also called The Sign, is one of the best-selling debut albums of all time, and was certified nine times platinum in the United States. It was the first debut album to produce three number 1 singles on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 chart: &quot;All That She Wants,&quot; &quot;The Sign,&quot; and &quot;Don't Turn Around.&quot;\r\n\r\nFollowing the formal departure of singer Linn in 2007, the band performed a series of concerts as a trio in Europe and Asia between 2007 and 2009. Jenny Berggren revealed in November 2009 that she would be taking an indefinite leave of absence from the band to focus on a solo career. In 2009, Jonas and Ulf recruited two new female vocalists, Clara Hagman and Julia Williamson, and released The Golden Ratio in September 2010.\r\n\r\n\r\nArtists:...............-Ace of Base\r\nAlbum Name:............-Cruel Summer (Remastered)\r\nQuality:...............-Mp3, CBR 320 kbps\r\nGenre:.................-Pop, Eurodance\r\nSize:..................-114 MB\r\nTracks:................-13\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n01.
