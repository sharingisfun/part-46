Based on the 1988 movie of the same name, the show deals with a pair of con artists swindling rich women on the French Riviera. Lithgow brings debonair charm to the Michael Caine part, while Norbert Leo Butz (Wicked) proves to be a comic dynamo in the Steve Martin part. And Yazbek provides them with an array of catchy tunes (adorned in beautiful Bacharach-style arrangements by Harold Wheeler). Butz goes ballistic on the hilarious &quot;Great Big Stuff,&quot; which demolishes conspicuous consumption, then pairs up with feisty leading lady Sherie Rene Scott on &quot;Love Is My Legs,&quot; a wicked sendup of Celine Dion style torch epics. Meanwhile, Lightgow nails the tender ballad &quot;Love Sneaks In.&quot; A delicious jazz reprise of &quot;Nothing Is Too Wonderful to Be True&quot; by Scott and pianist Bill Charlap shows that Yazbek's songs don't need flashy pizzazz to be memorable. --Elisabeth Vincentelli\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:519c82eff660805a5e9e0eb4c02fe3e25d9d09a5","amp;dn":"Dirty+Rotten+Scoundrels+-+Original+Broadway+Cast+Recording","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"519c82eff660805a5e9e0eb4c02fe3e25d9d09a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,156,130,239,246,96,128,90,94,158,14,180,192,47,227,226,93,157,9,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
