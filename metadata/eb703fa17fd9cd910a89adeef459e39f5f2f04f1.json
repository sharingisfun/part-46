This new continent will be a place where their family can live free from the intervention of Winterpole, a global rule-maker run by bumbling bureaucrats. But eleven-year-old pink-and-plastic-obsessed Vesuvia Piffle, the secret mastermind behind the villainous Condo Corp, also has her sights set on this new land, and she wants to use it to build a kind of Miami-on-steroids. Now, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a race against time and across the world as the kids gather the items they need to create their continent. Because whoever controls the eighth continent controls our future. And the future canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be both &quot;greenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and pink","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb703fa17fd9cd910a89adeef459e39f5f2f04f1","amp;dn":"The+8th+Continent+by+Matt+London+%28retail%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb703fa17fd9cd910a89adeef459e39f5f2f04f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,112,63,161,127,217,205,145,10,137,173,238,244,89,227,159,95,47,4,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
