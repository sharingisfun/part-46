The album continues with Rebirth - very relaxing sounds of (among others) choir, flute and a little bird: a wren. The next song, Grace, is rather different, starting with intriguing synth-sounds and some rhythm, with nice melodies following. In Compassion you will find a lot of different atmospheres, with overtones, mouth-harp and choir, some rhythm, thunderstorm and rain, and a beautiful theme at the end. Peace starts full of expectation, fulfilled by the calming sounds of flowing water, nice arpeggios and a peaceful melody; a feminine calling is answered by uplifting themes. In the last song, Reunion, there are several powerful parts as well as softer ones, with appealing sounds from nature: melting ice, dolphins, gulls.\n\nreference libFLAC 1.3.1 20141125\n\nSecure rip.
