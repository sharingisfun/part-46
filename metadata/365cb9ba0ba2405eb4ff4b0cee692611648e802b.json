My shiny new 2TB drive arrived this week (Toshiba Canvio - HDTC720EK3CA, if you're interested), so I've spent a few days transferring from the old 1.5TB unit, as well as adding back some old/bad games I had archived off to make space - see link below for full list. I am also getting some new games, now I have the space, so will upload even more soon.\n\nGame Name [ID] [FORMAT] : Wii Casper's Scare School - Spooky Sports Day [RX4E4Z] [WBFS]\nLanguage                : ENGLISH (maybe others, not checked)\nType                    : Ghostly Sports Mini Games\n\n\n** IMPORTANT **\nPlease seed to at least 200%/2.0 each (i've got my uTorrent set to 500%/5.0).\nDo not just leech and run. Help others get a chance to download it quickly too. I'm doing this to help. Please help too.\n\nAs ever, if you like it, maybe buy a Wii game to keep the franchise going as a thank-you for this freebie! Even better, get one not listed on here, and upload for me :-)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll of my 740+ of my Wii games are listed here (text file format directory listing):          &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://txt.do/0v5n&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://txt.do/0v5n&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFeel free to search and see if there is a missing one you want me to upload - add a request in the comments and i'll try to help out.\n\nPlease Google the title or game ID if you want to know about this or any of the other games, as I can't remember half of them myself to answer any questions. Also check YouTube for a review/demo of games, as some are pretty crap (like Ninjabread Man and the Billy the Wizard). Those are just for OCD people like me who simply *must* get all the Wii games they can...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:365cb9ba0ba2405eb4ff4b0cee692611648e802b","amp;dn":"Casper%27s+SSD+%5BRX4E4Z%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"365cb9ba0ba2405eb4ff4b0cee692611648e802b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,92,185,186,11,162,64,94,180,255,75,12,238,105,38,17,100,142,128,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
