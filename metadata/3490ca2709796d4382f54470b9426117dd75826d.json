Her first mission: return to the Delta Quadrant and open diplomatic relations with the Confederacy of the Worlds of the First Quadrant, a civilization whose power rivals that of the Federation. Captain Chakotay knows that his choices could derail the potential alliance. While grateful to the Confederacy Interstellar Fleet for rescuing the Federation starships from an alien armada, VoyagerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s captain cannot forget the horrors upon which the Confederacy was founded.\n\nMore troubling, it appears that several of VoyagerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s old adversaries have formed a separate and unlikely pact that is determined to bring down the Confederacy at all costs. Sins of the past haunt the crew members of the Full Circle Fleet as they attempt to chart a course for the future. Will they learn much too late that some sins can never be forgivenÃ¢â‚¬Â¦or forgotten?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3490ca2709796d4382f54470b9426117dd75826d","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+Voyager%2C+acts+of+Contrition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3490ca2709796d4382f54470b9426117dd75826d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,144,202,39,9,121,109,67,130,245,68,112,185,66,97,23,221,117,130,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
