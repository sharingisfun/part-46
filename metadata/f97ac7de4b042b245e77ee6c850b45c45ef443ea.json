And as you can see, a lot of these tracks have names from real magiÃ‘ï¿½ tricks.\nThis album has been a real adventure and a big achievement for me, and I hope you will enjoy my full story.&quot; Ferry Tayle\n\nThrough his music and DJ performances, he has left an indelible mark on the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most enlightened, uplifted and energetically minded club &amp; festival floors.\nHaving rocked the legendary Trance Energy in 2010 he was christened Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthe French WizardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ by ID&amp;T bosses and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a label thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s endured.\nNow Ferry Tayle returns to again do justice to the tag with the follow up to his Ã¢â‚¬ËœCarnet De VolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ debut.\nThrough the sonic-stage of Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe WizardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ludovic Meyer brings another astounding collection of tracks to the fore. Featuring frisson-thrill collaborations with studio likeminds Daniel Kandi, Driftmoon, Suncatcher and Karybde &amp; Scylla, it also includes vocal performances from accomplished songstresses like Hannah Ray, Poppy, Sarah Shields, Erica Curran and others.\nTogether, Always Alive, Enhanced Music and Ferry Tayle are delighted to bring you the album that is primed &amp; match-set to soundtrack your summer end to endÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ With an astonishing auditory display of studio-sourced sorcery, the man who puts the Trance into France is back!!\nThrough its choralizing pads, dramatic, symphonic drums and juxtaposing piano chime, fittingly titled sign-in track Ã¢â‚¬ËœLet The Magic HappenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ serves a precedent-setting overture to the album.\nHaving already bagged a DJ Mag Single of the Month, Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Way Back HomeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ features vocalist PoppyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“straight-from-the-heart verses &amp; chorusÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which at the breakÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s apex Ã¢â‚¬Å“sees the lightning conclusively hit the treeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (says the Mag).\nPicking up tempo and tone at pace, Ã¢â‚¬ËœGeometrixÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ sees Ferry team up with Finnish/Slovak pairing Driftmoon, delivering the first of its big slam-the-brakes euphoric moments!\nFrom there the album sequences into a solid block of Tayle-trax, which shows the Frenchman at his full-force, solo mode, floor-wowing best. Ã¢â‚¬ËœMetamorphosisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ re-channels the epic sonic ethic of ArminÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœBlue FearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, while the violin-soaked (jaw)drop of Ã¢â‚¬ËœGlorious DeceptionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ brings grand orchestral aura to Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe WizardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tracklist.\nHis new album-built 2014 revision of Ã¢â‚¬ËœTrapezeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ meanwhile searches the studioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soundbanks, locating lucent, sophisticated pads &amp; highly original FX, which Ferry spins into complex, cultured sequences.\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœThe WizardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is every bit as much at home on vocal territory as it is instrumental. Sarah Shields brings it one of its most daytime radio friendly moments with Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Most Important ThingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, while Ferry catches Hannah Ray in introspective mood on the doucement elegance of Ã¢â‚¬ËœMemory Of MeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\nErica Curran adds a wistful hazy vocal-vogue to the of-late smash single Ã¢â‚¬ËœRescue MeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, before muse Poppy returns for her second appearance on the album.\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœThe One I'll Never BeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ has Ferry dropping out the beats &amp; bass, and working around a core of contemplative piano lines and PoppyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sweetly elegiac lyrical pathos.\nAs FerryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second long-player moves into its concluding third, the Frenchman rallies some of his fellow countrymen composers to Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe WizardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cause. Respectively, on Ã¢â‚¬ËœGlittering Of HopeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœBattle Of The BarrelsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ferry teams with SÃƒÂ©bastien Ã¢â‚¬ËœKarybdeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Henri &amp; Laurent Ã¢â‚¬ËœScyllaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Roux and Oliver Ã¢â‚¬ËœStonevalleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Picart, betting against gravity with two huge rocketeer-ing instrumental numbers. Every bit as uplifting are Ã¢â‚¬ËœFlying BlueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœOrigamiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, which have him sharing studio time &amp; space with fellow Enhanced Recordings cohorts Daniel Kandi and Suncatcher. Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe WizardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe WizardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ without its eponymous title track.\nUsing it as the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fanfare conclusion, the track is a masterclass in beat-free, air-drawn orchestral strings, super-atmospheric ambient FX and pianoforte magic. The calm after the storm, it gives Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe WizardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ the most memorable of dÃƒÂ©nouements.\n\nBiography:\nFerry Tayle (born Ludovic Meyer, 1982) is a French DJ and trance producer living in Strasbourg, Alsace, France.\n\n\nSupport the artists you like by buying their music! &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.beatport.com/charts/ferry-tayle-the-wizard-chart/287368&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.beatport.com/charts/ferry-tayle-the-wizard-chart/287368&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-wizard/id887004596&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-wizard/id887004596&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f97ac7de4b042b245e77ee6c850b45c45ef443ea","amp;dn":"Ferry+Tayle+-+The+Wizard+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f97ac7de4b042b245e77ee6c850b45c45ef443ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,122,199,222,75,4,43,36,94,119,238,108,133,11,69,196,94,244,67,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
