A ghastly, frightening creature with claws, fangs, and a taste for human flesh. As he ran out of the forest, Toby felt that he'd been lucky to escape with his life.\n\nYears later, Toby finds comfort with the creature. It's his own special secret--something that nobody else in the world knows about. Somebody to talk to. Somebody to confide in. Sure, Toby has concerns about his own sanity, but really, what boy wouldn't want to be best friends with a monster in the woods, especially if he's being tormented by bullies? The creature, who he names Owen, may be the answer to his problems...\n\nFrom Jeff Strand, the author of PRESSURE, comes the story of a macabre, decades-long friendship. A relationship that will last their entire lives, through times of happiness, tragedy, love, loss, madness, and complete darkness.\n\nDWELLER. The lifetime story of a boy and his monster.\nGenre: Horror, Thriller, Humor","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7a91df7a7e9bfde868e1e114da4915cc4dda99b","amp;dn":"Dweller+-+Jeff+Strand.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7a91df7a7e9bfde868e1e114da4915cc4dda99b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,169,29,247,167,233,191,222,134,142,30,17,77,164,145,92,196,221,169,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
