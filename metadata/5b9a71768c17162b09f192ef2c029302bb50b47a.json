Children are in pain, they are suffering, their parents are desperately praying for god to protect them.&quot; - Dan Barker\n\n&quot;We're relative creatures, and that is how we understand things, and we can never have a conception of something that is bad, until we understand what is good. That reality, that co-existence is necessary in this world. If one wants to say that evil should not exist then the earth should not exist. You and I should not exist, trial should not exist, and exam should not exist. Rather we are in a system where we understand that evil is there.&quot; - Hassanain Rajabali\n\n&quot;Yes, I am under trial, if I could have stopped September 11, I would have but &quot;God is not under trial.&quot; So it is irrelevent to for Him.&quot;\n- Hassanain Rajabali\n\n&quot;No matter what they [the Atheists] thought of Hassanain's arguments, they all agree that he was pleasant and articulate. He shows a good face of Islam.&quot; -Dan Barker, after the debate ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b9a71768c17162b09f192ef2c029302bb50b47a","amp;dn":"Theist+Vs+Atheist+Debate%3A+Does+God+Not+Exist+1st+Debate","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b9a71768c17162b09f192ef2c029302bb50b47a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,154,113,118,140,23,22,43,9,241,146,239,44,2,147,2,187,80,180,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
