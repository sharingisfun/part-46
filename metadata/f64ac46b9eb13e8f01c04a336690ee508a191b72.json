This book examines past, present and future practices and thinking, including the wide-ranging interests within society that influence attitudes towards animals and conversely how animal welfare scientists may influence those attitudes.\nKey themes of the book include:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Multi-disciplinary working and its benefits: how we can obtain fresh insights, enliven our thinking and improve animal welfare by operating widely within diverse disciplines\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Questioning the fundamental assumptions we each make about animals and their functional capabilities.\nThe authors acknowledge the fieldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debt to past successes in animal-based science disciplines, successes that markedly improved animal welfare long before the concept of animal welfare entered common parlance. They also recognise the problems which unexpectedly arose, and anticipate future successes.\nSuggesting innovative approaches to Animal Welfare Science, and written by world renowned experts, The Sciences of Animal Welfare is essential reading for anyone interested, studying or currently working in Animal Welfare Science.\n\nThis book is part of the UFAW/Wiley-Blackwell Animal Welfare Book Series.\n\nAuthor Information\nDavid J Mellor is Professor of Animal Welfare Science, Professor of Applied Physiology and Bioethics, and Co-Director of the Animal Welfare Science and Bioethics Centre at Massey University, New Zealand.\nEmily Patterson-Kane is an Animal Welfare Scientist at the American Veterinary Medical Association in Illinois, USA.\nKevin J Stafford is Professor of Veterinary Ethology and Co-Director of the Animal Welfare Science and Bioethics Centre at Massey University, New Zealand.\nUFAW, founded 1926, is an internationally recognised, independent, scientific and educational animal welfare charity.
