But the future isn't all she hoped it would be, and when appalling secrets come to light, Tegan must make a choice: Does she keep her head down and survive, or fight for a better future? \n\nAward-winning author Karen Healey has created a haunting, cautionary tale of an inspiring protagonist living in a not-so-distant future that could easily be our own. \n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd33ac5a7800a8664aa6176709bd82718392203b","amp;dn":"When+We+Wake+by+Karen+Healey+%7BPDF%2C+EPUB%2C+MOBI%7D+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd33ac5a7800a8664aa6176709bd82718392203b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,51,172,90,120,0,168,102,74,166,23,103,9,189,130,113,131,146,32,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
