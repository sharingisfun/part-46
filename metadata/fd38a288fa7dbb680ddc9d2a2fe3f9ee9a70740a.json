Without the benefit of piano, bass, or drums, they interpret the hard bop compositions of Kenny Dorham, Hank Mobley, Sonny Clark, and Freddie Redd, generally not even the better-known ones. The performances are quite concise (Dorham's &quot;Windmill&quot; is covered in 40 seconds), respectful to the melodies, and unpredictable.\n\nThere are hints of the avant-garde here and there, but also plenty of swinging, bop-oriented solos and coherent ensembles. Very intriguing music that is highly recommended to a wide audience of jazz and general listeners.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01.
