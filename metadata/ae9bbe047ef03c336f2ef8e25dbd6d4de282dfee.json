As an ex-screw, Jim's a lamb to the slaughter and soon he's begging for protection in the segregation block - along with the paedophiles and rapists. For Jim, there's only one way out - death or escape. Also, just when Sylvia Hollamby thinks her life is going to be ruined by an evil 'voodoo curse', her luck changes. The dashing Dr Malcolm Nicholson seems to have fallen for her and Sylvia is over the moon. Meanwhile, the two new inmates, credit card fraudsters Janine Nebeski and Arun Parmar, arrive on G Wing. Janine hates Arun for 'fessing up' in the witness box and she's bent on bloody revenge....\n\nEPISODE 1\nRogue guard Jim Fenner is banged up in a men's prison getting the comeuppance he deserves whilst two new inmates, Arun Parmar and Janine Nebeski, arrive on G-Wing.\n\nEPISODE 2\nJim Fenner is out of jail and smelling of roses - he's been re-instated in his old job and for the moment, it looks like nobody can smart him.\n\nEPISODE 3\nNaive Arun walks straight into a violent trap set up by Janine and Natalie Buxton, who beat her to a pulp.\n\nEPISODE 4\nOutside the heavy gates of Larkhall a swarm of press await the arrival of 18 year old Laura Canning, who has been convicted of brutally stabbing her mother to death.\n\nEPISODE 5\nNatalie is keen to show new arrival, Nun Sister Thomas, that a habit is no protection from the evils of G-Wing.\n\nEPISODE 6\nA new tough inmate, Pat Kerrigan, arrives at Larkhall transferred from another prison.
