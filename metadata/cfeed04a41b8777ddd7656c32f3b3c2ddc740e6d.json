Non Compos (formerly Non Compos Mentis) is the exception to that states painful regimen. &quot;The Rats Know Him&quot;, the band's second release, blasts forward to reassure the masses that the Green Mountain state has not yet forgotten it's northern hostility. The band delivered their assaulting debut, &quot;Smile When You Hate&quot; in late 1997 to a completely unsuspecting audience. After two years of bleeding ears within the confines of New England, Non Compos has once again blessed us with their disjointed aural storming.This is the Reference disc we walked out of the studio with to get mastered. A couple songs have a 'demo' feel.\n\n\n&quot;...sounds like an aural manifesto for the end of the world. That means they are heavier than any known substance in the universe.&quot;\n- Slap\n\n&quot;Non Compos offer up, without a doubt, some of the most sinister sounds ever to be unleashed from the Green Mountain state.&quot;\n- Suburban Voice\n\n&quot;A prime example of pure sonic brilliance. These guys churn out hateful, blistering tracks that are jam packed with crunching chords, evil screams and a blistering rhythm section to boot.&quot;\n- Under the Volcano\n\n&quot;Twisted rants accompany spine tingling surges of cacophonous destruction.&quot;\n- Ill Literature\n\n&quot;moshy, bass heavy, death meets metallic hardcore.&quot;\n- Brutalized\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfeed04a41b8777ddd7656c32f3b3c2ddc740e6d","amp;dn":"Non+Compos+-+The+Rats+Know+Him+%281999%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfeed04a41b8777ddd7656c32f3b3c2ddc740e6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,238,208,74,65,184,119,125,221,118,86,195,47,59,60,45,220,116,14,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
