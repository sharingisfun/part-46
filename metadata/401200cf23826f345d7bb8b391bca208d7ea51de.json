She admits to flossing her 20-year-old daughter's teeth, trimming her 15-year-old's toe nails and doing her children's homework for them. Amy says sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just trying to prevent her kids from being hurt or disappointed Ã¢â‚¬â€ but is she really just setting them up for failure? AmyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s son, Robert, 15, says heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s suffering in school because his mom wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let him do his own homework, and he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even know what heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s good at, because she does everything for him. Can Amy learn to take a step back and allow her kids to become independent? \n\nDr. Phil warns parents that success-only parenting doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work. Ã¢â‚¬Å“If you never let [your children] face adversity, when they do, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re likely to not know how to adapt. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t spoil your kids to the point where they never get knocked down. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be sorry if you do,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he says.\n\nType: TV Rip\nVideo format: MPEG-4 (MP4)\nAudio format: AAC 2ch stereo\nApproximate runtime: 40 minutes\nGenre: talk show\nAustralian air date: 21st November, 2013\n\n(commercials and promos removed)\n\n+includes MPC-HC thumbs+\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://drphil.com/shows/show/1981&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://drphil.com/shows/show/1981&lt;/a&gt;\n\n* please seed as much as possible after downloading to help keep this alive *","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:401200cf23826f345d7bb8b391bca208d7ea51de","amp;dn":"Dr.+Phil+Show+-+Outrageous+Parenting+Styles+%5B21-11-2013%5D+%7BOZFox4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"401200cf23826f345d7bb8b391bca208d7ea51de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,18,0,207,35,130,111,52,93,123,184,179,145,188,162,8,215,234,81,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
