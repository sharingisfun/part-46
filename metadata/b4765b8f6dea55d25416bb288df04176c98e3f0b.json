His stated preference is to apply his extraordinary abilities to the service of works with little or no representation on disc. So it&amp;#039;s surprising to think that this adventurous musician would partner with old-school conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt and record the five piano concertos of Beethoven, no less. But Aimard jumped at the opportunity, and the result is a set that merits attention. Both Aimard and Harnoncourt leave behind any preconceived notions, and their open-minded approach to these war horses is a breath of fresh air. Aimard&amp;#039;s formidable technique allows him to nimbly maneuver through Beethoven&amp;#039;s most treacherous passages with fleet-fingered precision, but his acumen and musical intellect are the guiding forces behind these incisive performances. The Chamber Orchestra of Europe responds beautifully to Harnoncourt&amp;#039;s crisp baton work, producing a vibrant sound that blends perfectly with Aimard&amp;#039;s dynamic pianism. The efforts of these exceptional artists prove that, in the right hands, core repertoire remains compelling and vital. \n\n\nPreview:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Beethoven-Piano-Concertos-Nos-1-5/dp/B000088DSQ/ref=sr_1_1/002-0510957-0404829?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1176510004&amp;sr=1-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Beethoven-Piano-Concertos-Nos-1-5/dp/B000088DSQ/ref=sr_1_1/002-0510957-0404829?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1176510004&amp;sr=1-1&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4765b8f6dea55d25416bb288df04176c98e3f0b","amp;dn":"CLASSICAL%3A+Beethoven+-+Complete+Piano+Concertos+%5B3CD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4765b8f6dea55d25416bb288df04176c98e3f0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,118,91,143,109,234,85,210,84,22,187,40,141,240,65,118,201,142,63,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
