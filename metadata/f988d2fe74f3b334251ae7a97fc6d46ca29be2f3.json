If you recognize the name at all, most know Adult Swim from their late night spot on Cartoon Network, giving home to cult classic TV like Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Sealab 2021, and Tim &amp; Eric Awesome Show Great Job!, and also ridiculous parodies including Childrens Hospital and NTSF:SD:SUV. But last year, Adult Swim curated an excellent Singles Program, giving viewers a free compilation of 13 exclusive singles from some fantastic names on the indie scene, including Wye Oak, Wavves, Flying Lotus, the Field, Com Truise, Death Grips, and Liars. This month, Adult Swim gives us another fantastic collection of new tunes with Garage Swim, a blazing mix of up and coming garage rock acts from all corners of the genre.\n\nAlbum review +online songs http://blog.kexp.org/2013/05/13/album-review-adult-swim-presents-garage-swim/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f988d2fe74f3b334251ae7a97fc6d46ca29be2f3","amp;dn":"GarageSwim","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f988d2fe74f3b334251ae7a97fc6d46ca29be2f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,136,210,254,116,243,179,52,37,26,231,169,127,198,212,108,162,155,226,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
