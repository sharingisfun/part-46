What stands out immediately, is the high quality of the production and arrangements, the sound being clear without losing that swampy, funky feel. Tony Joe White is a gifted guitar player and his playing is really fluid and bluesy and if you like comparisons, you can hear Chris Rea, J.J.Cale, Dire Straits and even Z.Z. Top in some of the songs. His voice sounds a bit flat in places and I prefer his singing when he's going for that low growl (as in Yo Yo Man rather than the higher pitch but overall this is classy stuff. Definitely recommended if you like laid back blues. \nAnyone who can rhyme slippin and skinny dippin' is certainly worth a deep investigation.   \n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nTony Joe White: Guitar\nKenny Aronoff: Drums\nCurt Bisquera: Drums\nSteve Potts: Drums\nLeland Sklar: Bass\nDonald Dunn: Bass\nBenmont Tench: Keyboards\nErnest Williamson: Keyboards\nLuis Conte: Percussions\nJim Spake: Saxophone\nNatalie Jackson: Background vocals\nMarleena Jeeter: Background vocals\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\nLake Placid Blues\nMenutha\nParis Mood Tonight\nBayou Woman\nThe Guitar DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Lie\nLet The Healing Begin\nLouisiana Rain\nThe Beach Life\nHigh Horse\nThese Arms Of Mine\nWampus Kitty\nYo Yo Man/Garter Belt\nDown Again\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Make Love Good For You\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff0df12f8ec32a1ccf8365f939dc3dbfcb4ca0e2","amp;dn":"Tony+Joe+White+-+Lake+Placid+Blues++%5B1995%5D++%5BRobbie60%5D+%5BFLAC%5D+%5BE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff0df12f8ec32a1ccf8365f939dc3dbfcb4ca0e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,13,241,47,142,195,42,28,207,131,101,249,57,220,61,191,203,76,160,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
