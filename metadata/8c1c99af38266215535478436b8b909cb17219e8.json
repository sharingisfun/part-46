But he's in command of a wide range of black music -- funk, soul, jazz, breakbeat and hip-hop (where his tastes run old-school and underground) -- and his beats can make you chuckle. Steinski loves straight comedy and exploits an impressive store of datedly &quot;hip&quot; spoken-word records to add extra irony to the history he evokes and reproduces. Because he's always preferred the popular to the esoteric, his uncleared samples have offended cultural capitalists from Walter Cronkite to the Incredible Bongo Band. Note that this rarities collection includes the excellent bonus radio-broadcast-turned-CD &quot;Nothing to Fear,&quot; which came out in 2002 and vanished soon after. Buy it while you can.\nGrade: A","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c1c99af38266215535478436b8b909cb17219e8","amp;dn":"Steinski+%5B2008%5D+What+Does+It+All+Mean","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c1c99af38266215535478436b8b909cb17219e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,28,153,175,56,38,98,21,83,84,120,67,107,139,144,156,177,114,25,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
