Did modern humans interbreed with Neanderthals or exterminate them? The program explores crucial evidence from the recent decoding of the Neanderthal genome.\n\nHow did modern humans take over the world? New evidence suggests that they left Africa and colonized the rest of the globe far earlier, and for different reasons, than previously thought. As for Homo sapiens, we have planet Earth to ourselves today, but that's a very recent and unusual situation. For millions of years, many kinds of hominids co-existed. At one time Homo sapiens shared the planet with Neanderthals, Homo erectus, and the mysterious &quot;Hobbits&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“three-foot-high humans who thrived on the Indonesian island of Flores until as recently as 12,000 years ago. \n\n&quot;Last Human Standing&quot; examines why &quot;we&quot; survived while those other ancestral cousins died out. And it explores the provocative question: In what ways are we still evolving today?\n\nThe other programs in the series are Part 1: &quot;First Steps,&quot; which looks at how, for millions of years, many species of small-brained human predecessors lived, and Part 2: &quot;Birth of Humanity,&quot; which profiles the earliest species of humans.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 55mn 53s 286ms\n\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\nLanguage          : English US\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Nature/Science\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 017 Kbps\nAspect            : 608 x 336 (1.810) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 132 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca6e08437c71cc7b282010c9fa44983a159208c1","amp;dn":"PBS+Nova-Becoming+Human+Part+3.S37E07.WS-PDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca6e08437c71cc7b282010c9fa44983a159208c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,110,8,67,124,113,204,123,40,32,16,201,250,68,152,58,21,146,8,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
