This incredible power tool allows an advanced user to virtually rebuild fragmented pictures &amp; photos from their fragments.\nÃ‚Â» Photorescue has established itself as the best performing digital picture recovery solution: its automated defragmentation algorithms allow it to consistently score better than its competition in independent tests. However, automated file defragmentation has its limits.\nThat is why Photorescue Advanced allows you to manipulate the clusters pictures are made of and adds interactivity and visual feedback to the data recovery process.\nÃ‚Â» PhotoRescue Advanced will first perform a normal data recovery scan. That first phase will usually recover a large number of full pictures and a few fragmented ones. Some files may actually contain too much data and need to be truncated to put the extra allocation units back into the useable cluster pool. In the second recovery phase, the user will manipulate those allocation units and will grow potential valid pictures out of the free cluster pool.\nDownLoad DataRescue PhotoRescue Advanced v2.1.697.
