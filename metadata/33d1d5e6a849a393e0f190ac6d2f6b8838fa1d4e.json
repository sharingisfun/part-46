Adeline   \\\n\\ wanted to create something new with LBA2 as they did with LBA1, while           \\\n\\ maintaining the feeling and sense of adventure of LBA1. After a year and a half \\\n\\ in production, LBA2 was finally released late in the summer of 1997.            \\\n\\                                                                                 \\\n\\                                                                                 \\\n\\ Twinsen chattingStory: LBA2 takes place a couple of years after the defeat of   \\\n\\ the tyrant Dr. Funfrock in LBA1. The planet has adjusted to life without        \\\n\\ FunFrock in power, and everything is peaceful. You start off on a quest to find \\\n\\ the weatherman, as bad weather is preventing you from travelling. But as you    \\\n\\ find him, and he clears the sky of dense rain clouds, UFOs land, and friendly   \\\n\\ Aliens emerge. The story revolves around those Aliens and their somewhat vague  \\\n\\ intentions at times. You travel across the three planets, Twinsun, Emerald      \\\n\\ moon, and Zeelich in an attempt to discover the truth regarding their           \\\n\\ intentions.                                                                     \\\n\\                                                                                 \\\n\\ Graphics: The Adeline team had, at the time, always been a pioneer in the field \\\n\\ of graphics. First implementing 3d into Alone in the Dark, then using           \\\n\\ incredibly detailed static backgrounds in LBA1, and pushing the boundaries with \\\n\\ prerendered backgrounds in Time Commando. It was obvious from the start they    \\\n\\ were going to do something new with LBA2 yet again. And they did.               \\\n\\                                                                                 \\\n\\ LBA2 boasts a full 3D world, something not so common in the world of adventure  \\\n\\ gaming during that time. LBA2 is a world of detailed and lush terrain, fluidly  \\\n\\ animated characters, and special effects rarely used during its day was the     \\\n\\ norm in LBA2, such as the rain on Citadel Island when you first start the game, \\\n\\ or the fiery lava on Celebration Island.                                        \\\n\\                                                                                 \\\n\\ LBA2 also used a completely rewritten game engine, the &quot;Nectar&quot;, which made all \\\n\\ the graphics possible in LBA2. One thing can be said about LBA2&amp;#039;s graphics      \\\n\\ without uncertainty; they leave the game playable to this day with little       \\\n\\ complaints.                                                                     \\\n\\                                                                                 \\\n\\ Audio: Philippe Vachey, who composed the soundtrack for LBA1 continued to       \\\n\\ compose music for LBA2. The music of LBA2 had a more epic feeling to it, aimed  \\\n\\ at emphasising the feeling of battle. Unlike LBA1, LBA2 features a fair amount  \\\n\\ of fighting, with soldiers far more common and aggressive, and even better      \\\n\\ equipped. The soundtracks adjust to that, so say a location you visit is        \\\n\\ over-run by the emperors soldiers, the music track would blend into a track     \\\n\\ with a more epic upbeat feeling to it. Also, like LBA1, there are voice overs   \\\n\\ for all the characters. One word comes to mind while were on the topic of voice \\\n\\ overs, Mosquibees...                                                            \\\n\\                                                                                 \\\n\\                                                                                 \\\n\\                                                                                 \\\n\\ Franco&amp;#039;s IslandGameplay: The gameplay in LBA2 has not changed much compared to  \\\n\\ the one of LBA1, except for some small new functions. You can still use the     \\\n\\ same behaviour scheme with the Normal, Athletic (now called &amp;#039;Sporty&amp;#039;),          \\\n\\ Aggressive and Discreet modes. As an addition Twinsen can now avoid projectiles \\\n\\ with  some dashing moves that are different in all four behaviour modes. The    \\\n\\ health meter, magic meter and clover boxes are still there. There are again     \\\n\\ four levels of magic in which the magic bar will extend and the magic ball will \\\n\\ become more powerful. In the beginning of the game you start with the first     \\\n\\ level of magic again. There is still place for twenty-eight different items.    \\\n\\ There are more weapons than in LBA1, including a laser pistol and an            \\\n\\ upgradeable blowgun.                                                            \\\n\\                                                                                 \\\n\\ Overall: LBA2 expands upon the sense of adventure displayed in LBA1. While the  \\\n\\ game is at times lacking in puzzles, or scenarios requiring you to think your   \\\n\\ way out, it is an improvement over its predecessor in terms of gameplay. Its    \\\n\\ strongest point is its ability to fully immerse the player in a world that is   \\\n\\ unique and funny.                                                               \\\n\\                                                                                 \\\n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33d1d5e6a849a393e0f190ac6d2f6b8838fa1d4e","amp;dn":"Little+Big+Adventure+2+ISO%2BWin+XP%2FW2k+Patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33d1d5e6a849a393e0f190ac6d2f6b8838fa1d4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,209,213,230,168,73,163,147,224,241,144,172,109,47,107,136,56,250,29,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
