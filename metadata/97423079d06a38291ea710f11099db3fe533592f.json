On the edges of Las Vegas,        \n 17-year-old Andrew's life is spiraling out of control.  \n Unable to cope with the loss of his father, Andrew's    \n descent into drugs and violence is gaining momentum,    \n and the once promising young man is now headed for      \n self-destruction. Andrew's mother, helpless to control  \n her son and fighting an addiction of her own, refuses   \n to watch idly as her only child destroys himself. As a  \n last resort, she hires a private company to forcibly    \n kidnap and confine him in a locked-down and corrupt     \n psychiatric hospital. As Andrew is subjected to the     \n secret physical and emotional abuses of the program     \n something inside him is re-awakened. He must somehow    \n get free to save what's left of his life, but to do     \n that, he knows he must first face his own demons        \n head-on.                                                \n                                                         \n\n\n\n\n  C A S T  \n\n\n                                                         \n                                                         \n              Diane Venora ...
