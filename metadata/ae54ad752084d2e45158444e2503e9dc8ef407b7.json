This is a recording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nActs hitting the top 40 for the first time include Twisted Sister, Bananarama, and Peter Wolf.\n\nOne artist in the countdown has a clause in his performing contract which states that if his name is mis-spelled on tickets, posters, and marquees, he gets a ten percent bonus.\n\nA listener wants to know, &quot;What recording act has put the most songs into the top 40 without ever hitting number one?&quot;\n\nWe find out who is the biggest British act in the history of the British charts, and it isn't the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, or Elton John.\n\nThe best story Casey tells is of a singer in the countdown who received 50 copies of Billboard Magazine in the mail, and 49 of them weren't his. It seems this artist took out an advertisement on the back cover of the magazine that caused the US post office to also deliver him copies belonging to Hugh Hefner, Frank Sinatra, and Doc Severinsen.\n\nOne person becomes the first black recording artist to ever have the same song on the pop chart, the soul chart, and the country chart at the same time.\n\nLW#1: Ghostbusters - Ray Parker Jr.\n40:    Cover Me - Bruce Springsteen\n39:    We're Not Gonna Take It - Twisted Sister\n38:    Two Sides Of Love - Sammy Hagar        \n37:    My, Oh My - Slade     \n36:    17 - Rick James     \n35:    Right By Your Side - Eurythmics    \n34:    Eyes Without A Face - Billy Idol\n33:    Jump (For My Love) - The Pointer Sisters\n32:    Cruel Summer - Bananarama\n31:    When You Close Your Eyes - Night Ranger\n30:    Leave A Tender Moment Alone - Billy Joel\n29:    Alibis - Sergio Mendes    \n28:    Dynamite - Jermaine Jackson\n27:    Drive - The Cars\n26:    The Glamorous Life - Sheila E.\n25:    All Of You - Julio Iglesias &amp; Diana Ross\n24:    Legs - ZZ Top\n23:    Let's Go Crazy - Prince &amp; The Revolution\n22:    Breakin'...
