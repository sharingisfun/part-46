Lee Byung Hun (Joint Security Area) stars as Sun Woo, a unique character with a curious lifestyle Ã¢â‚¬â€œ he's not only a valued gang member and the proprietor of a hotel bar, but also the right-hand man to the powerful gang leader, Mr. Kang (Kim Yeong Chul). When Kang suspects that his beautiful young mistress Hee Soo (Sin Min Ah, from Volcano High) might be messing around with another man, he enlists Sun Woo's help to resolve the matter, commanding him to follow her around to see what information he can dig up. Sun Woo's orders are explicit: if he catches Hee Soo cheating, he is to execute her Ã¢â‚¬â€œ no ifs ands or buts about it. However, when Sun Woo spies Hee Soo with her boyfriend, he makes a stunning decision, one that will have major consequences for all involved!\n\nAlthough the hit film Crying Fist barely edged it out for the top spot at the box office, A Bittersweet Life is a success in its own right, hailed by critics as a dazzling neo-noir thriller, chocked full of breathtaking cinematography, intriguing characters, and an ample dosage of violence just for good measure. In addition, Lee Byung Hun is earning critical raves for his performance as Sun Woo, a super-cool hitman with motivations all his own. But in the end, will Sun Woo make it out alive? Find out in A Bittersweet Life, a film that highlights the shadowy underbelly of Korean society, a place where the streets are dark with something more than night.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet this... One of the best korean movies if you ask me, totally awesome.\n\nAsiantorrents","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e3e8a02a71bfb250bc4868e4c49b27b18b8aae3","amp;dn":"A+Bittersweet+Life+%5BKorea+2005%5D+Yeah%21+Finally+here%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e3e8a02a71bfb250bc4868e4c49b27b18b8aae3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,62,138,2,167,27,251,37,11,196,134,142,76,73,178,123,24,184,170,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
