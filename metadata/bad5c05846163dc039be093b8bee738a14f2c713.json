However, if you look hard enough you can \nfind them floating around on the Internet ;)\n\nThe quality of the CRC recording is flawless, leaving one with the only \nassumption that it is straight off the soundboard, and is debatably better \nthan And All That Could Have Been (2002). Some tracks are very similar \nto Still (2002), yet they have more soul behind them, most likely due to \nthe audience's presence. Each and every track is a polished piece of work \nthat if they were to have replaced the original album versions no one \nwould have know. The CRC Sessions is a unique live recording that until \nAnd All That Could Have Been (2002) was released was by far the highest \nquality recording of live Nine Inch Nails, and still could be, you decide.\n\n:: kudos to the original uploader ::\n\n\nBest speeds (1 active torrent): \n(1)client uptodate \n(2)client-port open \n(3)uploadspeed=80% of real max uploadspeed\n\nhttp://www.DarkSideRG.com/\nhttp://www.TorrentMind.com/\nhttp://www.FileSoup.com/\nhttp://www.P2Punite.net/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bad5c05846163dc039be093b8bee738a14f2c713","amp;dn":"Nine+Inch+Nails+-+CRC+Sessions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bad5c05846163dc039be093b8bee738a14f2c713","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,213,192,88,70,22,61,192,57,190,9,59,139,238,115,138,20,242,199,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
