Released in 1983, it was the lead single off their second album, Reach the Beach, and is one of the group's best known hits. Their signature song is the follow-up single &quot;One Thing Leads to Another.&quot;\n\nAn extended 4:24 version of &quot;Saved by Zero&quot; is included as a bonus track on the 2003 reissue of Reach the Beach. The song was featured in the fourth season of TV series Breaking Bad.\n\nFixx frontman Cy Curnin reflected on its meaning in a 2008 interview:\n\n&quot;It was about looking at your own life, not so much about amassing material things but about experiences that lend you to be blissful... The song was written from the point of view of the release you get when you have nothing left to lose. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sort of a meditation. It clears your head of all fears and panics and illusions and you get back to the basics, which is a Buddhist mantra, which I practiced back then, and which I still do. The idea of the song is how great it is to get back to zero.&quot;\n\n\nBrian Grant had been chosen by MCA to direct the music video for &quot;Saved by Zero.&quot; While the label had previously been financially apprehensive with The Fixx, upon the rising commercial significance of music videos, a large budget was granted for &quot;Saved by Zero,&quot; allegedly providing &quot;lunches, massages, and fourteen stylists.&quot; The heavy price tag, however, ultimately persuaded MCA to financially lighten up in future endeavors.\n\nThe beginning of the video pays homage to the 1941 film classic Citizen Kane by Orson Welles. The premise sees Cy Curnin playing a painter who creates the artwork for Reach the Beach. He is stranded at a flat, and he reminisces about his childhood. Another scene features Curnin painting his naked torso with white and red acrylic paint tubes.\n\n&quot;Saved by Zero&quot; would become one of The Fixx's most popular songs and a concert staple. It has been described as having &quot;acutely captured the paranoia of the Cold War in fearful lyrics.&quot; Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine named it an AMG Track Pick and called the song a &quot;cool, robotic slice of synth pop.&quot; The song entered the charts on May 28, 1983 at #80 and reached a Billboard Hot 100 position of 20 and a Mainstream Rock position of 9.\n\n\nThe Fixx is an English rock band formed in London in 1979. Their hits include &quot;One Thing Leads to Another,&quot; &quot;Red Skies,&quot; &quot;Stand or Fall,&quot; &quot;Saved by Zero,&quot; &quot;Sign of Fire,&quot; &quot;Are We Ourselves?,&quot; &quot;Secret Separation,&quot; &quot;Driven Out,&quot; &quot;How Much Is Enough?,&quot; and &quot;Deeper and Deeper,&quot; which was featured on the soundtrack of Streets of Fire.\n\nThey are one of the few bands to have enjoyed significant success outside their country of origin, notably in the United States and Canada, yet remain almost unknown in their home land. The band is best known for their song &quot;One Thing Leads to Another&quot;, from their most successful album Reach the Beach in 1983.\n\nLong-time bassist Dan K. Brown re-joined the band in 2008. The Fixx regularly tour the U.S., and recently celebrated 25 years of making music together, accompanied by the release of the 2 CD set Twentyfifth Anniversary Anthology compilation.\n\nWith the classic lineup back intact, The Fixx released their 10th studio album Beautiful Friction on July 17, 2012.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saved_by_Zero&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saved_by_Zero&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AagBPaaga&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AagBPaaga&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 6000kbps\n   Audio: LPCM 48000Hz stereo 2304kbps [DVD, 24 bits]\n   Duration: 00:03:34\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
