II\n(1987)\n\nKnown for an aggressively rhythmic style as rooted in James Brown funk as in traditional blues, Aerosmith were the top American hard-rock band of the mid-Seventies. After drug problems and internal dissension nearly destroyed the group, Aerosmith mounted a spectacular comeback in the 1980s. Despite a considerably more commercially slick and power-ballad oriented sound than theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d first emerged with, frequently drawing on outside songwriters, they managed to became even more popular the second time around.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nSource:\t\t\tFlac Conversion\n\nWhen Aerosmith got wind that their then-former record label, Columbia, was going to release a follow-up to the lifeless Classics Live!, the band wisely decided to get more involved this time around. The result is arguably the band's finest live album, even though it may be a bit short (not even 39 minutes in length). But the performances are vibrant and focused -- almost all were taken from the reunited lineup's New Year's Eve, 1984 gig at the Orpheum Theater. The only criticism is that, again, the majority of the tracks were already released as live versions (on 1978's Live Bootleg), and only three make their in-concert debut on record. Still, positively smoking versions of &quot;Back in the Saddle,&quot; &quot;Walk This Way,&quot; &quot;Same Old Song and Dance,&quot; &quot;Last Child,&quot; &quot;Draw the Line,&quot; and &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; rock out like no other Aerosmith live recording. The album's undisputed highlight is a fantastic rendition of the autobiographical early nugget &quot;Movin' Out,&quot; as well as the title track from the Joe Perry Project's 1980 debut, Let the Music Do the Talking (which was subsequently re-recorded for Aerosmith's Done with Mirrors). Although Live Bootleg may contain more songs, the more succinct Classics Live! Vol. 2 succeeds with it's consistent, fiery performances. \n\n01.Back In The Saddle\n02.Walk This Way\n03.Movin' Out\n04.Draw The Line\n05.Same Old Song And Dance\n06.Last Child\n07.Let The Music Do The Talking\n08.Toys In The Attic\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab790beb72e841908b1e3039e7e39854bbf034af","amp;dn":"Aerosmith+-+Classics+Live%21+II+%281987%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab790beb72e841908b1e3039e7e39854bbf034af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,121,11,235,114,232,65,144,139,30,48,57,231,227,152,84,187,240,52,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
