Seeing as they don't sell CD's anymore, there is no way they can release their music to the world anymore.\n\nThis torrent includes all three albums:\n\n-The Storm\n-Rainy Day\n-Operation: Rolling Thunder\n\nAs said in the title, encoded by LAME, 245 Kbps VBR.\n\nScans of all album art, inner cover, and back. Some inner covers are autographed, and have large blank spaces where the special thanks should be. I only erased the special thanks area to protect the identity of those neither in the band, or guests of the band.\n\nBand website: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://myspace&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://myspace&lt;/a&gt; (dot) com/uncommonknowledgeseattle\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe6422e92af7df98026c0427a3d6c47370fb05a5","amp;dn":"Uncommon+Knowledge+Full+Discography+%5BLAME+Encoded+245+Kbps+VBR+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe6422e92af7df98026c0427a3d6c47370fb05a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,100,34,233,42,247,223,152,2,108,4,39,163,214,196,115,112,251,5,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
