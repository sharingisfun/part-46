All the better known tracks are here and they really do the band good service. A few spins of this will have any latter day heavy rock fan understanding what all the fuss was about. Early thrashers like Madhouse, towering thrash metal tunes like Caught in a Mosh and I Am the Law segue into the body of this release where socially aware stuff like Indians, funny off the wall tunes like I'm the Man and well known covers like Anti-Social and Got the Time live. \n\nBacked up by the heavy duty metal of the tracks from Persistence of time (the last studio effort prior to Belladonnas first exit) this is an ablum for those with a strong constitution and an ear for talent. An excellent taster for this band rendered perhaps a touch redundant in light of later, expanded compilations. (Customers from Amazon)\n\n\n\n\n01. Air\n02. Madhouse\n03. Caught In A Mosh\n04.
