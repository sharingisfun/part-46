Included are descriptions of the following features:   \n\n     1.   Device Driver Installation  \n\n     2.   Usage Tracking of Custom Applications when the Device Driver is \n          Loaded  \n\n     3.   Disable \\&quot;Shelling\\&quot; to DOS with Device Driver \n\n\nShould you have questions, Fifth Generation System\\'s technical support staff\nis available by calling 504-291-7283 Monday through Friday 7 AM to 7 PM\n(Central Time).  We hope you enjoy using Direct Access 5.1!  \n \n============================================================================\n\n1.   Device Driver Installation (Optional)  \n\n     The Direct Access Network Device Driver must be installed on each    \n     workstation separately using the installation routine INSTLDEV.EXE or  \n     using an editor to modify the CONFIG.SYS file.  After installation, the\n     workstation must be rebooted to activate the Device Driver. \n    \n\n============================================================================\n\n2.   Usage Tracking of Custom Applications when the Device Driver is Loaded \n     \n     Two entries will occur in the Usage Tracking Log file for a Custom\n     Application if the Direct Access Network Device Driver is active.  This\n     will not affect the total time recorded for the application because the\n     first entry will have N/A as the total time.  \n\n\n============================================================================\n\n3.   Disable \\&quot;Shelling\\&quot; to DOS with Device Driver \n\n     You may want to use the Device Driver to prevent access to DOS by\n     disabling the ability to \\&quot;shell\\&quot; out of applications.  To prevent\n     shelling, you must do two things: \n\n     1.   Install the Device Driver as described in the User\\'s Manual.\n          Answer \\'Yes\\' to the question that asks \\'Do you wish to activate\n          security?\\' \n\n     2.   For any menu items that have the capability to shell out to DOS,\n          you will need to change one of the option settings. \n\n          a.   Go to Create/Modify Sub-Menus for the item for which you\n               will disable the \\&quot;shell\\&quot; function. \n\n          b.   Press the F8 key. \n\n          c.   Set the option for \\'Disable Control-Break\\' to \\'Yes\\'.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd3f451b5f83c8b2ef723da064f1b27ebf3b94c1","amp;dn":"Direct+Access+v5.18+for+DOS+MS-DOS+Menu+System","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd3f451b5f83c8b2ef723da064f1b27ebf3b94c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,63,69,27,95,131,200,178,239,114,61,160,100,241,178,126,191,59,148,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
