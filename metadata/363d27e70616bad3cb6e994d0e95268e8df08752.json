You can try running it on firefox, or use the stand-alone flash projector..\n\nLocally saved games work fine..\n\nAlso, the graphics glitches are now fixed, so you can drag gems around just fine..\n\nAlso, revision 2 was freezing at the end of field F3.. This is fixed in revision 3..\n\nI think/hope that I shouldn't have to fix any more problems with this.. I tested it a little and every thing seems to work fine this time.. Have fun..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:363d27e70616bad3cb6e994d0e95268e8df08752","amp;dn":"Gemcraft+2+Chasing+Shadows+v1.0.12+Cracked_Rev.3+Works+on+Linux","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"363d27e70616bad3cb6e994d0e95268e8df08752","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,61,39,231,6,22,186,211,203,110,153,77,14,149,38,142,141,240,135,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
