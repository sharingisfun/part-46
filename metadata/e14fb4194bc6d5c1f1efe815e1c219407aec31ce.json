Enlisting the help of wildlife experts, National Geographic deconstructs this battle.\n\nLions and Buffalo and Crocs, oh my!\n\nFor those of you who aren&amp;#039;t part of the 29 million people who have watched this breathtaking, and surprisingly well-taped Youtube video, this is your chance. Even if you watch with one hand over your eyes, that&amp;#039;s fine, just make sure you can peek through your fingers.\n\nI can&amp;#039;t say enough about NGC&amp;#039;s 45 minute insight into this video. Don&amp;#039;t get me wrong, the eight minute video, shown as the conclusion, is the highlight of the show, but there is a nicely fleshed out back story with lots of information thrown in, including a step-by-step breakdown of the video.\n\n\nAs one who had not previously viewed the Youtube video, the anticipation quietly built as I watched the program. At times I found myself pitying, and rooting for, a young African Buffalo, being fought over between a Pride of Lions and a Crocodile. Then my own hypocrisy caught up with me, (Did I have a burger for lunch?), and I started to feel for the hungry, inexperienced Lions.\n\nMy emotional tug-of-war didn&amp;#039;t last long as the herd of African Buffalo stormed back to try and rescue their young. The conclusion shows one especially heroic Buffalo that inspires the herd in an attempt to scatter the Lions.\n\nIt is truly amazing to see animals in the wild, whom are believed to be inferior to humans, act more emotional and heroic than some of us. Maybe this is where our army came up with the idea that no one gets left behind.\n\nI recommend watching this program for a more enhanced and detailed viewing of the battle at Kruger.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------\n[img]http://img90.imageshack.us/img90/6232/battleatkrugerscreen0oy8.th.jpg[/img] [img]http://img90.imageshack.us/img90/6263/battleatkrugerscreen1fg7.th.jpg[/img] \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD 1.0.3\nVideo Bitrate: 1827 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 688x448\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.536:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 128kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 45:27.840\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 638MB\nSubtitles: tvcap , NO\nRipped by: jvt40\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1) Further Information \n* NGC Battle at Kruger home\n\n2) Related Documentaries \n* Desert Lions\n* Lions - Spy in the Den\n* Lions of Crocodile River\n* Lions of the African Night\n* Super Pride\n\n3) ed2k Links \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: http://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Battle_at_Kruger","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e14fb4194bc6d5c1f1efe815e1c219407aec31ce","amp;dn":"National.Geographic.Battle.at.Kruger.DVB.XviD.MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e14fb4194bc6d5c1f1efe815e1c219407aec31ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,79,180,25,75,198,213,193,241,239,232,21,225,194,25,64,122,236,49,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
