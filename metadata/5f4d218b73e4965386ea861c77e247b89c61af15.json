Seemingly more accidental than intentional, the production is clean and separated. Yet it has a roomy quality that highlights the superb musicianship here. The set starts out with a fast and furious version of &quot;Got My Mojo Workin'.&quot; Otis Spann's Delta-inspired voice shines over the group, which sounds very tight, and much like the Chess sessionmen. &quot;Moon Blues&quot; is a song highlighted with fuzz guitar leads and a '70s sound. The funky &quot;I'm a Dues Payin' Man&quot; is a refreshing change of pace on the album, while &quot;Bird in a Cage&quot; is a soulful instrumental. Coming through as the standout track, &quot;Bird in a Cage&quot; reaffirms blues musicians as some of the best players in music. The track showcases Ray Charles-esque piano playing and blues saxophone -- which takes away from the song by adding a '70s feel to the recording. Overall, this is a tight record by a man with one of the best voices in the blues.[/color][/quote]\n\n\n\nTracklist\n1. Got My Mojo Working 3:01\n2. Sellin' My Thing 7:22\n3. Moon Blues 4:25\n4.
