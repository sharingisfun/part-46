Hopefully enough people will hear her to make her the last woman to have to bear the title Ã¢â‚¬Å“George ZimmermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s girlfriend.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ It seems that, after a fight with his girlfriend, George Zimmerman sent her young daughter an image of him and her mother having sex. This guy should either be jailed, or he should primary Trey Radel in next yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s election. His campaign theme could be Ã¢â‚¬Å“Come on, FloridaÃ¢â‚¬â€you can do worse than Trey Radel if you try!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSamantha Scheibe says that George fell into deep depressions whenever his name dropped out of the news. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not good coming from a guy whose only way of getting into the news is to kill or hurt somebody. When asked about George ZimmermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s obsession with guns, his former neighbor just said Ã¢â‚¬Å“Well, boys will have their toys, as they say.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Toys? These are guns weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re talking about. George Zimmerman didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t kill Trayvon Martin with lawn darts.\n\nJohn Boehner is not going to take any disciplinary action against Congressman Trey Radel after he was found guilty of cocaine possession. Hey, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to give someone a lecture about substance abuse when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re slurring your words.\n\nThe Republican attacks on the Affordable Care Act are part of an organized effort to relentlessly assault Obamacare until they destroy it. Republicans are going to attack healthcare until weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re all dead, and this effort should hasten that moment. The GOP strategy is the result of a month of closed-door strategy sessions. Geniuses! It took them a month to come up with a plan than boils down to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Burn, baby, burn!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nFinally, Rush Limbaugh cut off a caller who brought up his past drug use. Odd... most recovered addicts are perfectly willing to discuss their past. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s part of recovery. I guess Rush must not be recovered. Rush is definitely not recovered from anything! Look at how morbidly obese that sea cow is! At the very least, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s replacing the narcotics with cheesecake.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7bbe4e3a6871ab35827958f23e422e39cae06dd","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+November+21+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7bbe4e3a6871ab35827958f23e422e39cae06dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,187,228,227,166,135,26,179,88,39,149,143,35,228,34,227,156,174,6,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
