Westerns are full of guitar playing cowboys.  Well here is an accordion playing, fast shooting, tough cowboy.  Great co-stars with Audie Murphey and Dan Durea.\n\nMr Stewart plays a trouble-shooter for the railroad that was unfairly fired but gets a chance to prove his value some years later. \n\nWide-screen, color, avi, DVD rip, excellent quality, english only, no subs\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0050763/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0050763/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ce3c48b51050d75ab25fbde53cb822d7518024e","amp;dn":"James+Stewart+Night+Passage+-+1957+Audie+Murphy.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ce3c48b51050d75ab25fbde53cb822d7518024e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,227,196,139,81,5,13,117,171,37,251,222,83,203,130,45,117,24,2,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
