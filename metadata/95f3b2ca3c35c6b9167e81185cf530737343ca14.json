No Predator\nrocket-launcher guys, for example, but a Predator as the Spy, a class that&amp;#039;s\nsupposed to cloak and primarily use a knife anyway.&quot;\nSMID\n\n&quot;But this, we want this to be the defining point in AvP2 modding. Half-life has\ncounterstrike, Quake had Team Fortress, but AvP2 never really had its killer mod\nand that saddens me. I will do whatever it takes to help make this happen, and I\nwant to do it before Fox throws us under the truck.&quot;\nTheOracle\n\nKnown issues:\n=============\n- when joining or starting a game for the first time, if no character was\nselected before joining, the character type is undetermined.\n- the ladder from the blue base (&amp;#039;Our Collective Fate&amp;#039;) that links the\nundergrond section to the blue base can block players. In such a case,\nsimlply jump down and try climbing it by pressing the jump key.\n\nRequirements:\n=============\n1. Aliens vs. Predator 2 installed\n\nInstallation:\n=============\n1) Before unpacking the archive in your AvP2 folder, please back up the\nfollowing files:\n- AvP2Serv.exe\n- ServerDataunnamed.txt\nYou can do that by either renaming them as &quot;Vanilla_AvP2Serv.exe&quot; and\n&quot;Vanilla_unnamed.txt&quot; or by moving them into a backup folder.\n2) unpack the archive in your game folder.\n\nUninstall:\n==========\n1) delete the AVP2FORTRESS.REZ, AvP2Serv.exe and ServerDataunnamed.txt files\nfrom your game folder\n2) restore the original versions of AvP2Serv.exe and ServerDataunnamed.txt from\nthe backups made before installation of the mod. \n\nTo start the mod, simply double click the AvP2Fortress.bat file.\n\nThanks go to:\n==============\n- Windebieste:\n- the maps for the mod and one of the issues of &quot;Alien Art&quot;\n\n- Moose_Head:\n- the flag model\n\n- Coty:\n- door models\n\n- jegu:\n- finding and converting the skybox for Gunnison County Forest\n\n- The_One:\n- forest background sounds for the Gunnison County Forest map\n- hosting the site\n\n- Vemarkis:\n- attributes for MP attachments (helmet, headset) and taunts\n- beta testing\n\n- Artalavista:\n- skybox in the &quot;Blue Collar&quot; map\n\n- MasterPlan inc. and Fullerene Productions Inc. :\n- textures in the &quot;Blue Collar&quot; map\n\n- The following artists: Max Kim, Roberto Huerta, HarryOverEnd, Fire Red Head,\nShiroikai, Sgt.
