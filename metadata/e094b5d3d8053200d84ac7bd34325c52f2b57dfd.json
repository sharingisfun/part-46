It was released in 1985, and was their first output in which English songs exceeded the number of Gaelic ones.\n\n&quot;O Cho Meallt&quot; (Much Deception) - 3:04 \n&quot;This Darkest Winter&quot; - 4:29 \n&quot;Lifeline&quot; - 4:09 \n&quot;Air a' Chuan&quot; (On the Open Seas) - 5:09 \n&quot;Dance Called America&quot; - 4:33 \n&quot;The Everlasting Gun&quot; - 4:26 \n&quot;Skye&quot; - 3:31 \n&quot;Cnoc na FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ille&quot; (The Hill at the Market Stance) - 4:40 \n&quot;The Wire&quot; - 5:28 \n&quot;An Ataireachd ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â€šÂ¬rd&quot; (The High Surge) - 4:30 \n&quot;The Ferry&quot; - 4:12 \n&quot;Tuireadh Iain Ruaidh&quot; (Lament for Red John) - 2:42 \n\nAlthough many regard the The Cutter &amp; The Clan as representing Runrig at the height of their powers, my own feeling is that this album steals that spot. This was their crossover album from Gaelic to mainstream. It retains the Gaelic feel of the earlier albums but has none of the commercial element that tended to dog _The Cutter and the Clan_and later albums. As a crossover album it has the feel of a debut album and as such retains the youth and energy that many debut albums have. There are several standout tracks, &quot;Dance Called America&quot;, &quot;Everlasting Gun&quot;, &quot;This Darkest Winter&quot; and the excellent &quot;Skye&quot;.\n\ncd rippped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e094b5d3d8053200d84ac7bd34325c52f2b57dfd","amp;dn":"Runrig...Heartland%281985%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e094b5d3d8053200d84ac7bd34325c52f2b57dfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,148,181,211,216,5,50,0,216,74,199,189,52,50,92,82,242,181,125,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
