I had heard people refer to this one, but hadn't seen it for myself until recently. One of the better buddy-action movies I've seen, due to a very tight script. Superior writing by George Gallo. The story is what drives this movie from beginning to end, and doesn't need to depend solely on the cast to keep the audience interested for the full 2 hours. DeNiro and Grodin are excellent together, with a great supporting cast. I would keep this movie in my personal collection. I would also consider it a fine example for other buddy action movies to follow, even today. Highly recommended for great comedic writing, directing and acting.
