And nothing much changes throughout the album, whether it is the surefire rock of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThis TownÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, which has been done thousands of times before, or the fun and summery ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTimeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that screams to be a rock radio single. The band seems to excel on these ditties, not really challenging the listener, but giving them plenty to grin about. The Machines also rarely mail in performances, especially when the tender, slower, and memorable ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMy Girlfriend SaysÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ comes on. However, they put the album on its head with a country-meets-rockabilly surprise called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d Like to Thank You AllÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. There is not a lot here to choose from musically, as they simply hone their chops with each song, although ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSnatching Defeat (From the Jaws of Victory)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ seems to have the band losing the plot slightly. Perhaps the truly great song of the bakerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dozen is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThree Chord MontyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, which seems to bounce along perfectly a la the Jam or the Kinks.
