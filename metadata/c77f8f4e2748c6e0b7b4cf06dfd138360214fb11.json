Amnesia performs a smart scan to determine all related files to be removed.\n\nEasily uninstall not just applications, but also Screen Savers, Dashboard Widgets, and Preference Panes. Amnesia will remove logs, caches, application support files, preferences, crash reports, and other application specific files. \n\nTake the frustration and time out of searching for all of these files manually. In addition, turn on a secure deletion option to prevent recovery of the removed files.\n\nScared to i remove something you may need later? Amnesia comes with a built-in backup function which creates an archive of related files incase you wish to restore them at a later time.\n\nIt will reinstall the pieces of the product exactly where they came from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ even if you choose to restore to a different machine!\n\nAnother powerful feature Amnesia has to offer is the ability to create a list of Untouchables (in addition to the ones built-in). Untouchables are software products which Amnesia will warn you about incase a remove is attempted. \n\nThis is handy incase a particular software product should be removed using a manufacturer-provided uninstaller instead.\n\nWhats new:\n\nVersion 1.3.1:\n\n* Bug Fix: Fixed issue backing up files.\n\n* Bug Fix: No longer modifies the Dock .plist if no changes were made.\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nMac OS X 10.5 or later\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c77f8f4e2748c6e0b7b4cf06dfd138360214fb11","amp;dn":"Amnesia+1.3.1+%5BK%5Dracked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c77f8f4e2748c6e0b7b4cf06dfd138360214fb11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,127,143,78,39,72,198,224,183,180,207,6,223,209,56,54,2,20,251,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
