So I have uploaded a couple movies and they are being downloaded, which is good! I am trying something different.  I am uploading movies raw.  They are MKV format, but there is no loss in quality of video or audio, hence the size of the rips from blu-ray and dvd. In order to play MKV files you need the MKV codec or VLC.  If your using XBMC you are all set!  I've also decided that I would rather leave the choice up to the individual as to how they want the file. If your a purest and have the room like I do, than you can play them as is.  But you also have the option of compressing these any way you see fit for whatever device you want to use.  I am very curious about feedback, so please feel free to comment!\n\n_________________________________Movie_Details_______________________________________\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption  (1994)\n                              \nLanguage:        English\nSubtitles:       None\nRun time:        2 hours 22 minutes\n\nFormat:          Matroska (MKV)  If not using XBMC you will need codec or VLC\nFile Size:       5.84 GB\nResolution:      SD (720 x 480) 16:9\n\nAudio Format:    Dolby Digital\nChannels:        5.1 48Khz 16bit\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a043b94b80b5e6aa40077493da9e19255ebe0fb8","amp;dn":"The+Shawshank+Redemption.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a043b94b80b5e6aa40077493da9e19255ebe0fb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,67,185,75,128,181,230,170,64,7,116,147,218,158,25,37,94,190,15,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
