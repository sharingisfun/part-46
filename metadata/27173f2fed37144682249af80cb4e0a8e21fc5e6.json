But finally... movement! Budget slashing proposals from Paul Ryan, the Republican Study Committee, Ron Paul, Rand Paul and even Tim Pawlenty! But politicians and real people across the spectrum still resist change. What should government do? What's its role? What have other countries done? The Money Hole tackles that.\n\n \n----------\nif TPB is down, or it's upload is down, you can check etorrents.org for new posts\nany posts made there will be made here on TPB after any outage","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27173f2fed37144682249af80cb4e0a8e21fc5e6","amp;dn":"20110612-Stossel+Special-The+Money+Hole-Fox+News+Channel.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27173f2fed37144682249af80cb4e0a8e21fc5e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,23,63,47,237,55,20,70,130,36,154,248,12,180,224,168,226,31,197,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
