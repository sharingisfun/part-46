Occasionally the audio sync goes out, but it quickly returns. \n\nI have about ten more to transfer to WMV ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ those will be compiled and uploaded perhaps next month. Then I have the remainder of the series on video, which I must transfer to digital as soon as I get a chance. \n\nMy favorites here are Folge 2 and 4. Enjoy! \n\nComments welcome. \n\nPS ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ I usually shut down at night, so if you are trying to download and there are no seeds, keep the torrent open for at least a day or so until IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m back on. I will seed this for no more than a month unless the demand is high. Please seed at least to 200% to keep these rare films alive! \n\nThanks. \n\n\nFrom the WEB: \n\nThere may not be a finer series of films worth studying than the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Guten TagÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Guten Tag wie gehtÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ series, produced by Bayerischen Rundfunk and the Goethe Institut, in 1964-65, and 1966 respectively. Each series consisted of twenty six fifteen-minute films, was witty, charming, and consisted of funny mini-dramas embracing multi-ethnic and multi-cultural values. Entertaining, charming, funny, and occasionally thought-provoking, the films contained embedded socio-cultural messages that clashed with prejudices many North Americans still harbored toward Germans, nearly one generation after the second world war. The Germany of the mid-1960s, in the minds of many U.S. students, was eternally at the wrong end of gun-barrels, bomb-sights, and war-trials. \n\nTo many Americans of the era, the German archetype was cold, inhuman, devoid of humor, and heavily prejudiced against people of other races and ethnic origins. In essence the Nazi and the German were one and the same. This presents a marketing problem for any company selling German language instruction films in the U.S. If Germans arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t seen as being fun and socially progressive, people may not want to study the language, as they probably wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be traveling to Germany on vacation. Therefore, distribution figures will be so low, that the films wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t make a profit. \n\nClearly, in both ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Guten TagÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ series, the Goethe Institut had a social agenda that went far beyond creating a simple series of language instruction films, and, as such, they are worthy of further study. On one hand, they can be cynically perceived as being successors to the successful propaganda films of the Third Reich. On the other, with their reappearing themes of humor and racial and generational co-existence, they perhaps seek to define a new reality, as Germany strove to remake itself internally, and redefine itself externally. This new Germany, it was hoped, would be perceived as a radically different one than the uncredited executive producers knew North American students would most often have otherwise seen, from a cinematic and television perspective. \n\nThe films on tonightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s program make the case that a language film is more than just that. It serves as an introduction to the people speaking the language, and provides insight to the culture. I suspect the executive producers knew they had a big job at hand. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll have to judge their relative success yourself. The films are, unfortunately, out of distribution. Although widely distributed, and shown as a staple on NET (the precursor to PBS), their production values are somewhat dated. The workbooks, which at one time were easy to come by have been out-of-print for years, and can only be found with great difficulty in the most arcane of used bookshops. \n\nThese films should be seen again, not only for their cultural merit and their socio-political orientation, but also because theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re damn fine language instruction films, with a wit and charm all their own. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8310242eb612983aac873b46815982f66c6c5d49","amp;dn":"Guten+Tag+Wie+Gehts+%283%2C4%2C6%2C7%2C9%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8310242eb612983aac873b46815982f66c6c5d49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,16,36,46,182,18,152,58,172,135,59,70,129,89,130,246,108,108,93,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
