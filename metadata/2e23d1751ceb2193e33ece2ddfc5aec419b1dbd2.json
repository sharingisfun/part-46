Some stories include the supernatural and the paranormal; others are simply creepy tales and twisted views of average human beings. Each episode consists of two half-hour stories of mystery. Rock musician Henry Rollins opens and closes each half-hour section as the host of the show and only consistent member of the cast. Night Visions is an anthology series; none of the stories connect with each other in any way. They are all stories of completely different nature. From a story about an evil woman and her super intelligent dogs to a tale of killer shadows, Night Visions has all types of tales.\n\nIn total, Night Visions received one season before it was canceled by its parent channel, FOX Network. It is still occasionally shown on FOX, as well as the Sci-Fi Channel, although the scheduling is inconsistent. &quot;Fox's Night Visions,&quot; the episodes aired by FOX, ended with episode #20, entitled &quot;Darkness.&quot; However, the show was not complete there. Over a year later, Sci-Fi Channel aired episodes #21-26 within a few days. These &quot;Sci-Fi Night Visions&quot; were never aired by FOX.\n\nThis episode features\n Season 1, Episode 1 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Aired: 7/12/2001\nThe Passenger List\n\nJeremy Bell is a transportation official investigating an airplane crash with no survivors.
