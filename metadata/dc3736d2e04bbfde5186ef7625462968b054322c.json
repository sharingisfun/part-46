Deidre Jones should know, since she's doing just that. The first step was getting out of the mental hospital in St. Louis. There were those who tried to stop her. . .so she had to make them understand: Deirdre gets what she wants. And she wants her ex-husband, David, back. He's got a new wife and a little boy. He's forgotten what he and Deirdre once shared. But it will be easy enough to remind him now that she's moved in upstairs. . .\n\nNo Matter Who Has To Die.\n\nFor David, his time with Deirdre was a dark chapter he was glad to see end. Their marriage was based on dangerous, obsessive passion-and when David left, he never looked back. He'd hoped it was the same for Deirdre, but her &quot;neighborly&quot; behavior soon proves him wrong. She's doing her best to manipulate herself back into his life: through his child, through seduction. . .through murder. Because Deirdre will do anything to get what can never be hers-and now David is the only one who can stop her. . .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc3736d2e04bbfde5186ef7625462968b054322c","amp;dn":"The+Ex+-+John+Lutz+%28Retail","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc3736d2e04bbfde5186ef7625462968b054322c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,55,54,210,224,75,191,222,81,134,239,118,37,70,41,104,176,84,50,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
