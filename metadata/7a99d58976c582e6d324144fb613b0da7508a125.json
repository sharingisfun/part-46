Two young soldiers have voluntarily requested to be taken into the Afghan operation. Having met at a conscription department they are sent straight to the notorious ninth divisionÃ‚Â´s training camp on the border of Afghanistan. The ninth legion - gathered of the most aggressive and undisciplined men - has got one simple rule: the most heroic is always the one that appears first in the front line. Irrelevant to politics, The Ninth Legion is a movie about people and fate. Young soldiersÃ‚Â´ lives were filled with loss and defeat. They were fighting for the Soviet empire - for nothing: upon their return home the Soviet Union had already collapsed.\nRef:http://www.matilarohr.com/e","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a99d58976c582e6d324144fb613b0da7508a125","amp;dn":"THE_NINTH_LEGION-VIDEO_TS-Audio-Russian-NordicSubs-2005-pbed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a99d58976c582e6d324144fb613b0da7508a125","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,153,213,137,118,197,130,230,211,36,20,79,182,19,176,218,117,8,161,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
