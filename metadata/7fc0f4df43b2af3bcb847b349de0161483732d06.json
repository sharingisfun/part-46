Besides the aforementioned mister Petersen, Solna consists of musicians from all corners of the world with Pamela Moore being the most well known. Just in case there would be someone out there who has never heard of miss Moore: she is responsible for handling the vocals as Sister Mary on ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Operation: MindcrimeÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ and more recently (2007) she joined EdenÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s Curse for a duet on their ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Second ComingÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ platter.\nBut that doesnÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t mean that the other contributors to this album are complete unknowns, on the contrary! Who exactly are we talking about here? Well, we have singer Ralf Scheepers (Primal Fear, Gamma Ray), guitarist Alex De Rosso (Dokken) and bassists Ron De Luca (Spread Eagle, Sebastian Bach), Fabrizio Grossi (Steve Vai, Neal Schon) and Tim Harris.\nMusically Solna dabbles in classic hard rock with a dash of AOR.\nThe disc opens with a short intro in true QueensrÃƒâ€¹Ã¢â€žÂ¢che style (with a telephone that rings) followed by the ferocious rock of ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Blinded By The RainÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ on which Pamela Moore steals the show with her amazing vocals.\nNot so impressive is ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½CelebrateÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ that sees Ralf Scheepers handling the lead vocal part but fortunately this is only a small hick up as there is plenty of good stuff in the shape of power rockers such as ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Where Are You RunningÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½, ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Moment Of TruthÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ and ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Sent From HeavenÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½. The guitar playing by Alex De Rosso is especially tasty on these particular cuts. Other songs worth an extra mention are ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Feel AliveÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ (on which Ralf and Pamela share vocals) and the ballads ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Light And CandlesÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ and ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½DreamsÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½.\nTo sum thins up, this is a recommended release for those who like a quality mix of heavy rockers and more AOR tinged cuts.\n\nEnjoy and please seed after you have finished download as long as you can.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fc0f4df43b2af3bcb847b349de0161483732d06","amp;dn":"Solna-Eurameric-2009-SSR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fc0f4df43b2af3bcb847b349de0161483732d06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,192,244,223,67,178,175,59,203,132,123,52,157,224,22,20,131,115,45,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
