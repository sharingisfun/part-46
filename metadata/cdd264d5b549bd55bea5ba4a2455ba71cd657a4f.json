Unfortunately, this is the last Super Adventure to ever be published... in December 1987.  Because this is a &quot;Super Adventure&quot;, it has about 40 more pages than a typical CYOA book.\n\nDetails on back:\nAfter waiting for years, you've finally been invited to join the daring Society of Adventurers.  And as a new member, you must choose to embark upon one of three dangerous missions.  You can head to the Takia Makan Desert to hunt for a lost caravan.  You can search for priceless documents in the Himalayas.  Or you can track down two Americans who have vanished without a trace in the Hong Kong underworld!\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdd264d5b549bd55bea5ba4a2455ba71cd657a4f","amp;dn":"Danger+Zones+-+Choose+Your+Own+Super+Adventure+%232.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdd264d5b549bd55bea5ba4a2455ba71cd657a4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,210,100,213,181,73,189,85,190,165,186,74,36,85,186,113,205,101,122,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
