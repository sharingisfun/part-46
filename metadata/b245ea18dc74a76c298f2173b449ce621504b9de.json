It is seven years' worth of mostly very high-charting -- and all influential and important -- songs, leaving out some singles in favor of well-known album tracks, and in the process, giving an overview not just of the Rolling Stones' hits but of their evolving image. One hears them change from loud R&amp;B-inspired rockers covering others' songs (&quot;Time Is on My Side&quot;) into originators in their own right (&quot;Satisfaction&quot;); then into tastemakers and style-setters with a particularly decadent air (&quot;Get Off of My Cloud,&quot; &quot;19th Nervous Breakdown&quot;); and finally into self-actualized rebel-poets (&quot;Jumpin' Jack Flash,&quot; &quot;Midnight Rambler&quot;) and Shaman-like symbols of chaos. On its initial release, Hot Rocks sold well, not only as a unique compilation but also as a panorama of the 1960s. The only flaw was that it didn't give a good look at the Stones' full musical history, ignoring their early blues period and the psychedelic era. There are also some anomalies in Hot Rocks' history for the collector -- the very first pressings included an outtake of &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; featuring Eric Clapton that was promptly replaced; and the original European CD version, issued as two separate discs on the Decca label, was also different from its American counterpart, featuring a version of &quot;Satisfaction&quot; mastered in stereo and putting the guitars on separate channels for the first time. Those musicologist concerns aside, this is still an exciting assembly of material.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b245ea18dc74a76c298f2173b449ce621504b9de","amp;dn":"The+Rolling+Stones+-+Hot+Rocks%2C+1964-1971+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b245ea18dc74a76c298f2173b449ce621504b9de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,69,234,24,220,116,167,108,41,143,33,115,180,73,206,98,21,4,185,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
