Designed for use on Southern branch-line and suburban services with numerous stops and little need for high top speeds, the Class 455 runs in 4-car formations up to a maximum speed of 75mph, and remains a familiar sight around South London and all along the Southern network. A total of 137 Class 455 sets were produced, and with regular refurbishments taking place the type is still playing its part to keep Southern England moving.\n\n\nThe Class 455 for RailWorks 2, developed by Thomson Interactive, includes 3 liveries, accurately reproduced drivers cab and controls including functional DRA (Drivers Reminder Appliance), independent wiper selection, functional glare screen visor and opening cab windows (animated in-cab and external view), and all-new sounds recorded from a real Class 455.\n\nIncludes:\nClass 455 4-car train (DTSO/MSO/TSO vehicles)\nBritish Rail Blue &amp; Grey\nNetwork Southeast\nSouth West Trains\n\n4 Scenarios:\nGuildford Bound\nSunday Shuttle\nEnd of Shift\nPushing the Boundary\nPLEASE NOTE: The Portsmouth Direct Line Expansion Pack is required to play the scenarios included with the Class 455.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e88f5d237c9cd2006f317ab52bc8af452e7db68","amp;dn":"RailWorks+-+Class+455","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e88f5d237c9cd2006f317ab52bc8af452e7db68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,136,245,210,55,201,205,32,6,243,23,171,82,188,138,244,82,231,219,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
