With Duarte Lobo and John IV of Portugal, he represented the &quot;golden age&quot; of Portuguese polyphony.\n\nCardoso was born in Fronteira, near Portalegre, most likely in 1566. \nHe attended the ColÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©gio dos MoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§os do Coro, a choir school associated with the ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°vora cathedral, studying with Manuel Mendes and Cosme Delgado. In 1588 he joined the Carmelite order, taking his vows in 1589. \n\nIn the early 1620s he was resident at the ducal household of Vila ViÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§osa, where he was befriended by the Duke of BarcelosÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½later to become King John IV. For most of his career he was the resident composer and organist at the Carmelite Convento do Carmo in Lisbon.\n\nCardoso's works are models of Palestrinian polyphony, and are written in a refined, precise style which completely ignores the development of the Baroque idiom elsewhere in Europe. His style has much in common with TomÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s Luis de Victoria, in its careful treatment of dissonance, occasional polychoral writing, and frequent cross-relations, which were curiously common among both Iberian and English composers of the time. \nThree books of masses survive; many of the works are based on motets written by King John IV himself, and others are based on motets by Palestrina. \n\nCardoso was widely published, often with the help of King John IV to defray costs. Many of his worksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½especially the elaborate polychoral compositions, which probably were the most progressiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½were destroyed in the Lisbon earthquake and fire of 1755.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nManuel Cardoso: \nRequiem, etc.\n\nThe Tallis Scholars\nPeter Phillips\n\n\nfile format: m4a.
