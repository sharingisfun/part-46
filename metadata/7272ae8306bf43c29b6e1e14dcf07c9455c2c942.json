He was awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for his mastery of the art of narrative, most recently demonstrated in 'The Old Man and the Sea', and for the influence that he has exerted on contemporary style.&quot;\n\nDuring the twenties, Hemingway became a member of the group of expatriate Americans in Paris, which he described in his first important work, THE SUN ALSO RISES (1926).  Equally successful was A FAREWELL TO ARMS (1929), the study of an American ambulance officer's disillusionment in the war and his role as a deserter.  Hemingway used his experiences as a reporter during the civil war in Spain as the background for his most ambitious novel, FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS (1940).  Among his later works, the most outstanding is the short novel, THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA (1952), the story of an old fisherman's journey, his long and lonely struggle with a fish and the sea, and his victory in defeat.\n\nHemingway -- himself a great sportsman -- liked to portray soldiers, hunters, bullfighters: tough, at times primitive people whose courage and honesty are set against the brutal ways of modern society, and who in this confrontation lose hope and faith.  His straightforward prose, his spare dialogue, and his predilection for understatement are particularly effective in his short stories.\n\n\nThis collection features all of Hemingway's novels and short stories, a large selection of his non-fiction (including several volumes of journalism and letters), and a number of anthologies.
