Her sizable body of work includes books and essays which address intertextuality, the semiotic, and abjection, in the fields of linguistics, literary theory and criticism, psychoanalysis, biography and autobiography, political and cultural analysis, art and art history.\n\nTogether with Barthes, Todorov, Goldmann, Genette, LÃƒÂ©vi-Strauss, Lacan, Greimas, and Althusser, she stands as one of the foremost structuralists, in that time when structuralism took a major place in humanities.  Her works also have an important place in post-structuralist thought.\n\n\nAll the following books are in PDF format:\n\n* THE FEMININE AND THE SACRED [with Catherine Clement] (Palgrave Macmillan, 2001).
