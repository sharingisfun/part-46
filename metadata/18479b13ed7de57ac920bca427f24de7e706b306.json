Asystole: A Portrait of Self-Actualization\n2. Tsunami Lullaby\n3. Tears of April\n4. Retalianna\n\nPersonnel:\nJon Sutherland\nJoe Bonner\nWes Forbes\n\nSymphonic metal from Philadelphia, PA.\t\n\nConceived by Jon Sutherland and Joe Bonner in 2008, the early days of the project saw a whirlwind of lineup changes, with many musicians helping to shape the character of the band. Seraph in Travail is a creative ensemble that draws influences from almost every corner of the metal world, though best known for its ferocious drumming, vicious screaming, symphonic undertones, memorable choruses, thrashing guitars and virtuosic solos. With the new addition of Wes Forbes on bass guitar, the previous months have seen the group hard at work on a heavier, darker, and dirtier self-produced 4-song EP that is sure to please. They are eager to join forces with a new drummer and a second guitarist and claw their way back into the local scene, where their raw, high-energy performances are likely to turn a few heads. \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18479b13ed7de57ac920bca427f24de7e706b306","amp;dn":"Seraph+in+Travail+-+Self-Titled+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18479b13ed7de57ac920bca427f24de7e706b306","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,71,155,19,237,125,229,122,201,32,188,164,39,242,77,231,231,6,179,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
