This year is no different. She sticks out like a sore thumb among the teenagers who have been summering (a verb only the very rich use) together for years. But Naomi finds herself captivated by her mysterious next-door neighbor, Jacinta. \n\nJacinta has her own reason for drawing close to Naomi-to meet the beautiful and untouchable Delilah Fairweather. But Jacinta's carefully constructed world is hiding something huge, a secret that could undo everything. And Naomi must decide how far she is willing to be pulled into this web of lies and deception before she is unable to escape.\n\nBased on a beloved classic and steeped in Sara Benincasa's darkly comic voice, Great has all the drama, glitz, and romance with a terrific modern (and scandalous) twist to enthrall readers.\n\nGenre: Young Adult","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:800ec0dad36dec11cbe28356b8f56fb0348b8546","amp;dn":"Great+by+Sara+Benincasa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"800ec0dad36dec11cbe28356b8f56fb0348b8546","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,14,192,218,211,109,236,17,203,226,131,86,184,245,111,176,52,139,133,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
