Belief in myths allows the\r\ncomfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought.\r\n\r\nâ€“ John Fitzgerald Kennedy (1917â€“1963)\r\n\r\nJust take a walk or drive around this time of year and you canâ€™t help noticing signs for the flu vaccine. Theyâ€™re pretty\r\nmuch everywhere, lining entire parking lots and walkways into markets. They encourage everyone to get the shot â€“\r\n\r\ntelling you to â€œwalk in anytimeâ€ and of course accepting insurance. Some even offer incentives to get the vaccine\r\nsuch as a giving a 20% off shopping pass with every flu shot. At workplaces across the country notices are sent out\r\noffering shots at flu clinics. Itâ€™s a full court press promoting the vaccine everywhere for everyone.\r\n\r\nI called my local pharmacy to find out who could get the shot. They told me I didnâ€™t even need a doctorâ€™s note. I asked\r\nif a pregnant woman could get the shot and they said that it wasnâ€™t contraindicated, but some people ask for\r\npreservative free shots. I asked if I was feeling under the weather if I could still get the shot and the answer was â€œsure\r\nno problem.â€\r\n\r\nSo itâ€™s easy. No doctorâ€™s note. All you need is insurance and if you donâ€™t have it just $31.99 per shot â€“ at least thatâ€™s\r\nthe price at my local pharmacy. It didnâ€™t even matter if you were sick youâ€™re ready for your shot. It couldnâ€™t be any\r\nsimpler.\r\n\r\nBut a couple of things were missing â€“ science and information. Of course there is no debate when questioning\r\nvaccination in general and so it goes with the flu vaccine. Simply blindly accept, roll up your sleeve and get the\r\ninjection that will supposedly protect you from getting sick. It has to be true doesnâ€™t it? The government and medical\r\norganizations have all signed on and each year there is more and more push for everyone young and old to get\r\nvaccinated. But letâ€™s do something youâ€™re never supposed to do â€“ ask questions and look for answers.\r\n\r\nOne of the most obvious questions is â€œdid the flu vaccine reduce deaths?â€\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE ALL THE TRUTH ABOUT THE SO CALLED &quot;VACCINES&quot; GET FILES TO LEARN MORE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c264030a44a2e40b8422af400e2b723988d5db09","amp;dn":"The+Real+Effect+of+Vaccines","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c264030a44a2e40b8422af400e2b723988d5db09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,100,3,10,68,162,228,11,132,34,175,64,14,43,114,57,136,213,219,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
