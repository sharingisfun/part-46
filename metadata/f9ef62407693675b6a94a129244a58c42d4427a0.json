The methods used have also been successful in healing a wide range of illnesses in children. Brandon Bays presents a simple guided exercise which teaches children to envision an adventure inside their own body. Here they can recall memories and, using imaginary balloons full of qualities such as courage, sense of humour, confidence or understanding, forgive anyone, including themselves, for hurtful situations they have experienced. This CD can be used to help any child from 5-12. \n2 CDs, 15 tracks, total running time 1 hr 33 min, 2004","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9ef62407693675b6a94a129244a58c42d4427a0","amp;dn":"Brandon+Bays-The+Journey+for+Kids","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9ef62407693675b6a94a129244a58c42d4427a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,239,98,64,118,147,103,91,106,148,161,41,36,74,88,196,45,68,39,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
