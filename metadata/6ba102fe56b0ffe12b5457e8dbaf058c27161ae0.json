Characters meet and reunite from one life to the next. Born and reborn. As the consequences of their actions and choices impact one another through the past, the present and the distant future, one soul is shaped from a killer into a hero, and a single act of kindness ripples across centuries to inspire a revolution. Everything is connected.\n\nThe film consists of six interrelated and interwoven stories spanning different time periods. The film is structured, according to novelist David Mitchell, &quot;as a sort of pointillist mosaic.&quot;\n\n\nStarring:\nTom Hanks\nHalle Berry\nJim Broadbent\nHugo Weaving\nJim Sturgess\nDoona Bae\nBen Whishaw\nJames D'Arcy\nZhou Xun\nKeith David\nDavid Gyasi\nSusan Sarandon\nHugh Grant","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ba102fe56b0ffe12b5457e8dbaf058c27161ae0","amp;dn":"Cloud+Atlas+HD+Bluray+Rip+X264+English+AC3+Audio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ba102fe56b0ffe12b5457e8dbaf058c27161ae0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,161,2,254,86,176,255,225,43,84,87,232,219,175,5,140,39,22,26,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
