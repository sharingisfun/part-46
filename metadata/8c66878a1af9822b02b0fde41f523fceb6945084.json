Set in sixteenth-century Istanbul, the novel is equal parts mystery, love story, and a philosophical discussion on the nature of art and artistic vision. Two men have been killed: Elegant, a miniaturist engaged (with others) on a book project glorifying the life of the sultan, and Enishte, the man who hired the artists to do the book. During a trip to Venice, Enishte became particularly entranced with the new Italian painting, particularly its use of perspective and figurative art. He urged his employees to adapt the new art form in their illustrations of the grand book they are producing. Black, Enishte's nephew, wants to win the hand of Enishte's daughter, Shekure, which he can only do by solving the murders. This intellectual mystery will appeal to fans of Eco, Pears, and Perez-Reverte.\n\nNancy Pearl, A review","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c66878a1af9822b02b0fde41f523fceb6945084","amp;dn":"My+Name+is+Red+-+Orhan+Pamuk+%28doxyerfre%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c66878a1af9822b02b0fde41f523fceb6945084","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,102,135,138,26,249,130,43,2,176,253,228,31,82,63,206,182,148,80,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
