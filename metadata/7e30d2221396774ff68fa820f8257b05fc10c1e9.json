These disturbingly morbid stories focus on a serial killing blind date and a murderous, psychotic priest.\n\nIMDB: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103898/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103898/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThis rip is the complete uncut version. Very sadistic, sick, cruel, violent and insanely gory movie. This movie should absolutely not be watched by fainthearted and sensitive people, but for all you sickos out there like me, enjoy!\n\nLanguage: German\nSubtitles: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e30d2221396774ff68fa820f8257b05fc10c1e9","amp;dn":"The+Burning+Moon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e30d2221396774ff68fa820f8257b05fc10c1e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,48,210,34,19,150,119,79,246,143,168,32,248,37,123,5,252,16,193,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
