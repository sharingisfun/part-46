Those that see them must have them and a grisly end awaits those that forcibly take them. A mother, who has just left her cheating husband, finds them and ghostly apparitions and strange occurrences follow her as she tries to make a go of it with her young daughter. A helpful decorator helps her solve the mystery and put the ghosts to rest. Or does he? \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a97140a710afb1e8aec457e6d3e8117326621b9","amp;dn":"The.Red.Shoes.2005.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a97140a710afb1e8aec457e6d3e8117326621b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,151,20,10,113,10,251,30,138,236,69,126,109,62,129,23,50,102,33,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
