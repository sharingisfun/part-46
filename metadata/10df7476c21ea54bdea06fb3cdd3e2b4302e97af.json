In the documentary, Giuseppe mixes a interview of Pasolini with several stills of filming of his most controverse film, SalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â² or the 120 Days of Sodom (1975), where Pasolini talks about his point of view of cinema, politics, art, sexuality and modernity.\n\nWe are on the set of SalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â² or the 120 Days of Sodom. Despite the storm of controversy generated by the film, Pasolini is relaxed, almost joyful. He lets a small camera team led by the journalist Gideon Bachmann follow him around, engaging him in a long and extraordinary interview/conversation. Initially uncertain, Pasolini transforms the interview into a long, clear-sighted and violent attack on society that accompanies photos of the set in a surprising juxtaposition of film and reality, revealing PasoliniÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s metaphorical portrait of modernity.\n\nThis is an unknown Pasolini, dramatically desperate and detached in the way he denies himself and other a chance, a future, though it is hinted at in the cathartic, liberating original finale of the film discarded by the director and reconstructed here photographically.\n\nPs: This release has English subs hardsubbed.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0966582/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0966582/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
