The boy, whose real name was never revealed, run away. He was adopted by a local tribe of Ã¢â‚¬Å“ape-men.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ They raised him to be one of their own, and he gred up to be one of them, forgetting all he knew of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“white manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ways and talk.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ But sure enough, as an adult, he got involved with some white foreigners. He fell in love with one of them, Ann Mason, who re-taught him English and generally helped him get in touch with the white settlers. But civilization did not appeal much to Kaanga, so he stayed in the jungle. He and Ann married. They went on live Tarzan-and-Jane-style in the jungle, fighting for good against everything from bad animals to dinosaurs to witch doctors to Germans.\n\nMore scantily clad Jungle babes and fun from the golden age!\n\nseed for all to enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b74f650e9e1ce95170c8070f0ecc445cb1a7574","amp;dn":"Kaanga%21++Fiction+House+1940+COMPLETE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b74f650e9e1ce95170c8070f0ecc445cb1a7574","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,116,246,80,233,225,206,149,23,12,128,112,240,236,196,69,203,26,117,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
