This is part of the well-reviewed essay he wrote as a contributor to the hilarious bestselling book &quot;Things I've Learned From Women Who've Dumped Me&quot; compiled by Ben Karlin (The Daily Show, The Colbert Report, The Onion). A veteran of the King Of Queens sitcom, Oswalt nowadays is a regular on the TV series The United States of Tara and will be making an appearance on the new sci-fi adventure show Dollhouse.\n\nM83\nThe very atmospheric, some think in the shoegazing style, French electro duo performs &quot;Graveyard Girl&quot; from their latest album, Saturdays = Youth.\n[Torrents of their albums can be found on this and other popular tracker sites. Worth a listen.]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3a5487711735db607c1976e3c3760e99387e985","amp;dn":"Carson.Daly.2009.03.11.Patton.Oswalt.%28part%29.TVRip.XviD-QG.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3a5487711735db607c1976e3c3760e99387e985","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,165,72,119,17,115,93,182,7,193,151,110,60,55,96,233,147,135,233,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
