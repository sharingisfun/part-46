It was from a German concert in 1981 for ZDF tv. Meat Loaf was guest for the Pop Rock show of December 19th, 1981. \nThis is the BBC broadcast (the ZDF broadcast will follow later this month) with 4 tracks. I added two great clips from 1978's Saturday Night Live with a fantastic performance of Two out of Three. These two clips alone are worth the download of the dvd.\n\nSetlist:\n1 Love and Death and an American Guitar\n2 All Revved Up\n3 Dead Ringer for Love\n4 Bat out of Hell\n5 All Revved Up (SNL 1978)\n6 Two out of Three (SNL 1978)\n\nPAL DVD\nRun. time: 37 minutes\nChapters: Yes for each song\nCover: Created and Included by me\nMenu: no\n\nCover:\n\nScreen:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cedc8e54e3d3cd7caf476511911758960d89b3e","amp;dn":"Meat+Loaf+Live+in+DOrtmund+1981+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cedc8e54e3d3cd7caf476511911758960d89b3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,237,200,229,78,61,60,215,202,244,118,81,25,17,117,137,96,216,155,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
