Based on a true incident, it graphically depicts the all-consuming, transcendent - but ultimately destructive - love of a man and a woman (Tatsuya Fuji and Eiko Matsuda) living in an era of ever escalating imperialism and governmental control. Less a work of pornography than of politics, In The Realm Of The Senses is a brave, taboo-breaking milestone, still censored in its own country.\n\nMenus-Yes\nExtras-Yes\n\nSpecial Features including\nNew audio commentary featuring film critic Tony Rayns\nNew interview with actor Tatsuya Fuji\nA 1976 interview with director Nagisa Oshima and actors Fuji and Eiko Matsuda, and a 2003 program featuring interviews with consulting producer Hayao Shibata, line producer Koji Wakamatsu, assistant director Yoichi Sai, and film distributor Yoko Asakura\nDeleted footage and U.S. trailer\n\nLet's get this SEEDED people!!
