Heralded as the &quot;UK-Goth-discovery of the new millennium&quot;, Cauda Pavonis have gone from strength to strength over the years. The writing duo of Su Wainwright (formerly Farr) and Dave Wainwright have created material that has graced television, radio, video, 3 albums and numerous compilation appearances. The soaring and powerful voice of Su Wainwright; driving tribal drumming of Dave Wainwright and crashing guitar work of Chris Hines has forged one of the most unique and distinctive unsigned bands in the UK. \n\nTheir albums have been heralded as &quot;gothic masterpieces&quot; and the 2003 Album, Sigil, had praise heaped upon it by some of the scenes most respected reviewers and was voted the &quot;Number 1&quot; album of 2003 by one of the UK's leading northern clubs, Carpe Noctum. The album caused so much of a stir that the band were interviewed in an half hour long program that featured 2 of the songs from Sigil, for ITV in the UK and tracks were snapped up for 6 compilations by record labels including Nightbreed/PPD and Strobelight Records. In 2006 the album sold out and was moved to digital download on iTunes/Napster/Rhapsody and a string of leading online stores. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Carnival NoirÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, the 2005 follow up EP, pushed their list of successes further. \n\nThe stage show has graced several of the UKÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s leading alternative venues including Nottingham Rock City, Cardiff Millennium Stadium, JBÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s in Dudley, Bristol Bierkeller and the famous Whitby Gothic Weekend) and has been described as 'powerful' and 'theatrical'. The music has been described as having 'raw, whooshing old school power'. The sound goes much further than that. Rich keyboard and synthesizer elements complete the Cauda Pavonis sound making the music markedly different and pushing the band beyond many of their contemporaries.\n\nAlbums:\n1999 - Initiation\n2000 - Pistols at Dawn\n2001 - Controversial Alchemy\n2003 - Sigil\n2005 - Carnival Noir (mcd)\n2008 - Wars &amp; Masquerades\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73023a27373784c906183c7f7f593f3546cff72e","amp;dn":"Cauda+Pavonis+-+Discography+%281999-2008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73023a27373784c906183c7f7f593f3546cff72e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,2,58,39,55,55,132,201,6,24,60,127,127,89,63,53,70,207,247,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
