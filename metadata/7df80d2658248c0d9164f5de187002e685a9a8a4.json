You do? Well, then it conversely stands to (un)reason that Not Reading ( &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/tag/Not+Reading&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/tag/Not+Reading&lt;/a&gt;  ) can be made even more enjoyable by plotless untwists such as this one:\n\nNot Reading Debuts ( &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/tag/Not+Reading+Debuts&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/tag/Not+Reading+Debuts&lt;/a&gt;  ) are packs cnotaining all first issues published and/or released during a given month which made an uploader's personal cut. February and m'self, respectively, in this case!\n\nThis debut Debuts pack contains:\n\n\n\n   Apocalypse Al     #1 (of 4) - Image Comics - Action / Humour / Supernatural\n\n   The Mercenary Sea #1        - Image Comics - Adventure / Crime / Historical\n\n   Undertow          #1        - Image Comics - Classical / Dystopian / Sci-Fi\n\n\n\nI was curious myself and checked, and 3/month is exactly my average rate for picking up new series, so this batch is very usual in that sense. It's unusual in that they're all by the same publisher - though again not unusual in that if that is the case, then that publisher is naturally Image. And no, I'm not going to describe each of these for you - start Not Reading descriptions and stop Not Reading the comics! :)\n\nps: In the spirit of full disclosure, I'll admit that your not getting something more obscure this month from me may also have to do with my own Not-Yet-Having-Read-ing...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7df80d2658248c0d9164f5de187002e685a9a8a4","amp;dn":"February%27s+Debuts%3A+Avoid+Not+Reading+these+like+the+plagesserit%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7df80d2658248c0d9164f5de187002e685a9a8a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,248,13,38,88,36,140,13,145,100,245,222,24,112,2,230,133,169,168,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
