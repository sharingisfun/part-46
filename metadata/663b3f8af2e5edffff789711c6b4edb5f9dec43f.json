His research interests include using observational seismology to study features of the crust, mantle and core. Recently, he has based his analysis techniques on large-scale seismic array data, using SAC as the primary seismological data analysis tool. Before embarking on his research career, Professor Helffrich was a programmer who developed and supported mainframe operating systems. Bringing this experience to the seismological realm, he has contributed to the development of SAC for ove\n\n\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:663b3f8af2e5edffff789711c6b4edb5f9dec43f","amp;dn":"The+Seismic+Analysis+Code%3A+A+Primer+and+User%27s+Guide+prabhu_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"663b3f8af2e5edffff789711c6b4edb5f9dec43f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,59,63,138,242,229,237,255,255,120,151,17,198,180,237,181,249,222,196,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
