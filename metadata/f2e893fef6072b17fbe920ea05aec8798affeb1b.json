What is the difference between prophecy and prediction, and how has it led to a misuse of the ideas of Nostradamus, as well as those of other post-biblical prognosticators? \n\n\n\nWhat is the nature of the oracular tradition in the West-stretching back to the oracle at Delphi-and how can Nostradamus be understood from this perspective? In The Essential Nostradamus, the highly regarded spiritual thinker and writer Richard Smoley provides a true sourcebook in the life and messages of one of history's most peculiar figures. \n\n\n\nThis volume offers a host of advantages beyond other collections of Nostradamus's work. Many commentators on Nostradamus take liberties in their translations, further confusing the matter of what the prophetic quatrains actually said. In The Essential Nostradamus, Smoley presents a fresh, scholarly, and literal translation of Nostradamus's Middle French, allowing readers to make their own determination as to the passages' historical references and accuracy.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2e893fef6072b17fbe920ea05aec8798affeb1b","amp;dn":"The+Essential+Nostradamus+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2e893fef6072b17fbe920ea05aec8798affeb1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,232,147,254,246,7,43,23,251,233,32,234,5,174,200,121,138,255,235,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
