It's good enough and rare enough to share. It's fairly heavy, unlike most of the shitty stuff being put out today. The vocals, guitars, and drums are all so good that it's a shame this band put out only one record.\n\nWhich you can all have now.\n\nEnjoy.\n\n\nTrack listing:\n\n01 Safe Passage\t\t\t\t3:50\n02 Swamp Water\t\t\t\t4:44\n03 Search For Greater Things\t\t3:52\n04 Bad Creation\t\t\t\t4:03\n05 Pulp\t\t\t\t\t2:26\n06 Precious\t\t\t\t3:32\n07 Meet My Maker\t\t\t4:06\n08 Lizard Bones\t\t\t\t4:54\n09 Million Dollar Gun\t\t\t4:20\n10 Revolution\t\t\t\t4:45\n11 The Path\t\t\t\t4:09\n\n\nS.S.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3013c7f1df25da1238956e9ea314c47031c397a4","amp;dn":"Manmade+God+-+Manmade+God+%282003%29+%28320+kbps%29+%5BSS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3013c7f1df25da1238956e9ea314c47031c397a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,19,199,241,223,37,218,18,56,149,110,158,163,20,196,112,49,195,151,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
