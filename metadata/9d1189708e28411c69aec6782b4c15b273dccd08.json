The music ranges from a cover of the rock &amp; roll classic &quot;Tossin' and Turnin'&quot; to the Western swing of &quot;Between the Lines,&quot; and from the country shuffle of &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; to the solo acoustic blues guitar pickin' on the standard &quot;The Glory of Love.&quot; Within this broad musical spectrum, Goodman delivers his original lyrics, both humorous and heartfelt. &quot;Banana Republics&quot; became a staple of Jimmy Buffett's repertoire after its inclusion on Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes. In &quot;Old Fashioned,&quot; Goodman tells of being &quot;out of date and born too late&quot; as he seeks the love of an &quot;old fashioned girl,&quot; but in fact the lines probably described his music as well. Both &quot;Between the Lines&quot; and &quot;That's What Friends Are For&quot; offer compelling, personal looks at the elusiveness of love, while on &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; Goodman goes for the laughs in a retelling of the old traveling salesman story.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d1189708e28411c69aec6782b4c15b273dccd08","amp;dn":"Steve+Goodman+-+Words+We+Can+Dance+To+%281976%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d1189708e28411c69aec6782b4c15b273dccd08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,17,137,112,142,40,65,28,105,174,198,120,43,76,21,178,115,220,205,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
