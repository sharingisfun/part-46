Unimpressed with his preposterous offer, the team soon departs. In case Lucius&amp;#039;s herbs are actually of medicinal value, however, Dr. Beckett visits the village to investigate.\n\nAfter a long delay, Beckett returns to Atlantis ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with Lucius. Because the Ancient city&amp;#039;s safety depends on its secret existence, Weir is appalled at the doctor&amp;#039;s thoughtless breach of security, but Beckett insists that Lucius is worth it. Despite her concern that Beckett is acting less like his usual rational self and more like a fawning schoolboy, Weir agrees to meet with the baker. But later, when Sheppard and McKay return from another mission, they find Weir, Teyla, Ronon and the rest of Atlantis&amp;#039;s personnel obeying Lucius&amp;#039;s every command with besotted obedience. Although they can&amp;#039;t guess how or why he&amp;#039;s doing it, Sheppard and McKay realize that, clearly, Lucius is controlling people&amp;#039;s minds.\n\nMcKay spots the baker drinking a mysterious potion and steals a small sample for analysis. He needs more of the substance to complete his research, however, so Sheppard returns to the village. There, he finds Lucius&amp;#039;s doting wives and friends pining for his return, even growing physically ill ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ as if they&amp;#039;re in withdrawal from drug addiction. They eagerly give him a sample of Lucius&amp;#039;s &quot;daily medicine&quot; after Sheppard promises to bring their beloved baker home.\n\nBack at Atlantis, Sheppard finds that McKay, too, has become one of Lucius&amp;#039;s mindless minions. Worse, Lucius has sent Beckett, Teyla and Ronon on an irresponsible mission to a Wraith-dominated planet. By sheer luck, they return unharmed after a fierce battle, jubilant to give their beloved Lucius a rare herb he asked them to collect there.\n\nReluctantly, Sheppard plays along with his friends&amp;#039; insanity until he can steal McKay&amp;#039;s half-finished research, abduct Beckett, and fly him to the mainland. There, as Beckett struggles through withdrawal, Sheppard pieces together Lucius&amp;#039;s secret. The potion ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ made with the herbs from the Wraith planet ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ allows Lucius to secrete a pheromone that stimulates the prefrontal cortex in the brains of people nearby, resulting in euphoric emotions and extreme suggestibility. Sheppard hasn&amp;#039;t inhaled much of the chemical so far, but that&amp;#039;s about to change: Teyla, Ronon and McKay are hunting for him. When they capture him, it won&amp;#039;t be long before he, too, succumbs to Lucius&amp;#039;s overwhelming charm.\n\nstory by\nBRAD WRIGHT &amp; ROBERT C.
