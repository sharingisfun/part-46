He travels around the country as he explores the United Kingdom's remarkable past, from the perspective of ordinary people. It's wide-ranging, beautifully filmed and a bit sentimental, but also hugely informative and full of good humour. Nobody does this sort of thing better.\n\n\n\n5)  Lost Worlds and New Worlds \nAs the second half of the series gets under way, he examines how Henry VIII's founding of the Church of England in 1534, followed by the dissolution of the Catholic monasteries, transformed the country's religious landscape, setting the tone for a century of sweeping change. He traces the rise of industry and commerce in Bristol and Scotland, discovers evidence of one of Britain's first black communities, and finds an artefact that sheds light on the Elizabethan conquest of Ireland - before explaining how a radical religious movement in Nottinghamshire laid the foundations for transatlantic migration.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img69/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img69/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img100/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img100/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img197/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img197/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img811/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img811/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img88/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img88/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img13/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img13/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img222/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img222/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img690/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img690/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img12/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img12/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1562 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 8\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_British_Story:_A_People%27s_History_%28TV_series%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_British_Story:_A_People%27s_History_%28TV_series%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c4745ae0056378497dfbbcffb4f45e32fb063b9","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Great+British+Story+A+People+History+Season+1+5of8+Lost+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c4745ae0056378497dfbbcffb4f45e32fb063b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,71,69,174,0,86,55,132,151,223,187,207,251,79,69,227,47,176,99,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
