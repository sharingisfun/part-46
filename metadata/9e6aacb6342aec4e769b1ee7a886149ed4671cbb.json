I don't remember the specs on it. But it works and I install it in virtual box at least 2 times a month using the loader. If it shows that this copy is not genuine, then use the loader to reset the 30 grace period, and then use the loader again to activate ultimate. I found that process makes it fully update-able and so on. \n\nMy internet sucks because it is only 3mb connection in a 3rd world country, but I can seed it constantly, and hopefully others will seed as well.\n\nI doubt the loader will give a false virus detection since I use avast paid version, and I get no warnings from it at all, (though it goes bonkers from some torrents here). \n\nThere is zero viruses in this torrent, I don't know how to brand a torrent like others do, but I want to give back to TPB since I have been downing and seeding tons of junk for a few years. \n\nPeace out and seed the torrent if you want to help others. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e6aacb6342aec4e769b1ee7a886149ed4671cbb","amp;dn":"Windows+7+Ultimate+%2B+Laoder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e6aacb6342aec4e769b1ee7a886149ed4671cbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,106,172,182,52,42,236,78,118,155,30,231,168,134,20,158,212,103,28,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
