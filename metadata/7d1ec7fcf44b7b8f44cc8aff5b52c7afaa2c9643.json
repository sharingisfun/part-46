When a crime brings them back to L.A., fugitive ex-con Dom Toretto reignites his feud with agent Brian O'Connor. But as they are forced to confront a shared enemy, Dom and Brian must give in to an uncertain new trust if they hope to outmaneuver him. And from convoy heists to precision tunnel crawls across international lines, two men will find the best way to get revenge: push the limits of what's possible behind the wheel.\n\nUpdated info:\n\nAUDIO:\n[X]ENGLISH DOLBY DIGITAL , 6 CHANNELS, 448KB/SEC (AC-3/5.1) \nNo Spanish or French 5.1 \n\nVIDEO: \n[X]NTSC 720x480, MPEG-2, PLAYBACK FRAME 24.00\n\nAspect Ratio 2.35 : 1\n\nSUBPICTURE/Subtitle(s):\n[X]ENGLISH\n[X]SPANISH\n\nRemoved trailers, fbi/other warnings, ads, previews, bonus features cut it all out.\nNo menu...sorry for those who may have wanted one.\n\nTOTAL TIME:01:46:40\n\nCHAPTERS:21\n\nRIPPED ON: JULY 30/09\n\nSIZE: 4.18GB\n\nEnjoy:)\n~GRIMREAPER420~\n\nPlease leave comments if you have a minute, and seed as much as possible.\nThank you to my friends of TPB!\n\nHow to burn:\nI use Nero Express, but you can choose whatever program burn video files.\nChoose Videos/Pictures&gt;DVD-Video Files\nAdd Fast_and_Furious_2009, and walaa\nSettings choose DVD 5 (4483MB)\nClick Next\nChoose recorder (which drive you use, need blank *prefer*DVD-R or DVD+R)\nChange disc name, and burn away@writing speed *prefer*8x, or more, but it may risk burning errors.\nEnjoy:) \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d1ec7fcf44b7b8f44cc8aff5b52c7afaa2c9643","amp;dn":"FAST+AND+FURIOUS+%282009%29+NTSC+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d1ec7fcf44b7b8f44cc8aff5b52c7afaa2c9643","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,30,199,252,244,75,123,143,68,204,138,255,91,82,199,175,170,44,150,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
