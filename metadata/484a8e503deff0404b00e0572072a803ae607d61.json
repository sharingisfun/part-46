Not to mention Sedna whose orbit is still speculative to science.\n\nNearly 200 objects are included, but not as static images, rather as living objects in a living universe. Enjoy the Solar System in realtime, in the future or past.\n\nBring the cosmos to life with an innovative timeslider. Let time take its course, how fast depends on the scale factor of the timeslider. A wipe with your finger and the simulator comes to life.\n\nFor a more exiting viewing experience various camera modes are available. Attach the camera to a planet or place it at a fixed location in space and let the celestial bodies pass by, in portrait or landscape mode, whatever you prefer.\nAnd that's still not all. \n\nA built in encyclopedia gives you useful information about each object of the simulation, extracted from Wikipedia.\nDon't miss this unique viewing experience, there is no easier way to explore the wonderful world beyond our planet.\n\nAnd if you ever feel &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, don't worry, because it's just a simulation.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Super smooth UI\n- Nearly 200 simulation objects\n- Simulation of real celestial body distances and dimensions\n- Adjustable simulator time with an innovative timeslider\n- Flexible camera system for a unique viewing experience\n- Portrait and landscape mode\n- Many HD textures, some of original recordings (NASA Voyager, Cassini spacecraft)\n- Many preference options\n- Ephemeris data based on NASA Horizons system\n- Orbit calculations with modified Kepler algorithms\n- Encyclopedia function, the most important information from Wikipedia\n\nWhat's New:\n\n- Fixed hangup and 'black hole' on the Samsung Galaxy S4\n- English encyclopedia typos corrected\n- Menu for Tutorial videos added\n- Milky Way adjustments\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.sfk.android.pocket.planets&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.sfk.android.pocket.planets&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:484a8e503deff0404b00e0572072a803ae607d61","amp;dn":"Pocket+Planets+v1.0.4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"484a8e503deff0404b00e0572072a803ae607d61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,74,142,80,61,239,240,64,75,0,224,87,32,114,168,3,174,96,125,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
