Files were created with EAC 0.99 and were \nencoded with FLAC 1.2.1 (upgraded to FLAC 1.3.0). With the death of MU,\nthis and other interesting rips created by these people will likely \ndisappear from the interwebs without some help from the P2P community.\nHelp keep these rare albums available by downloading, seeding, and \nsharing them with anyone interested.\n\nIt is *highly* recommended that you verify this album with PGP immediately\nafter downloading it. If you don't know what PGP is or how to use it,\ndownload GnuPG and learn. A brief run-through is included with the torrent, \nbut you'd better do some external reading. In short, download the torrent, \ncopy the PGP sig from freetexthost, import my public key (0x37921081), and \nverify the archive containing the album. Only an authentic copy of this rip \nwill return a good signature--discard any torrent that fails.\n\nPGP signature: freetexthost dot com slash izszlwmxjg\n\nPost comments, send feedback, requests, criticism to chabosun at gmail dot\ncom (encrypted, of course).\n\nKeep circulating the tapes.
