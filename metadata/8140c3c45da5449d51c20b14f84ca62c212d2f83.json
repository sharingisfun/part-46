Howver with this combination\nit is necessary to search out and select the desired file to display.\n\nThat is a small inconvience.\n\nMy wife and I prefer the earlier uploaded version of Tess even though\nit does not have subtitles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8140c3c45da5449d51c20b14f84ca62c212d2f83","amp;dn":"Tess+of+the+D%5C%27Urbervilles+%281998%29+BBC+TV+with+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8140c3c45da5449d51c20b14f84ca62c212d2f83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,64,195,196,93,165,68,157,81,194,11,20,248,76,166,44,33,45,47,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
