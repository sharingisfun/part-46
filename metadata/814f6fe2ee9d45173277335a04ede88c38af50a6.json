The songs were chosen by Barry, Robin, Maurice's widow Yvonne and Andy's daughter Peta. &quot;These are pretty much our personal favorites,&quot; Barry explains in the liner notes, which were written by the family. &quot;This is now the Bee Gees 50th Anniversary. And by the Bee Gees I mean all four brothers.&quot; &quot;I always see our songs as 'just us three brothers' having a good time,&quot; adds Robin Gibb. &quot;When I look back now, it is more about the journey, not the arrival.&quot; MYTHOLOGY also features a scrapbook of family photos, many never-before published, along with tributes from artists such as George Martin, Brian Wilson, Elton John, Graham Nash and the band's longtime manager Robert Stigwood.\n\n\nSpanning the Bee Gees' five-decade career, the set's 81 tracks touch on several of the group's best-known hits. But mainly, the collection digs into the Bee Gees' vast catalog to highlight deep tracks such as the early single &quot;Spicks And Specks&quot; (1966); the title track from the 1969 concept album Odessa; the single B-side &quot;Country Woman&quot; (1971); &quot;Spirits Having Flown&quot; (1979) the title track from the 35-million selling album; &quot;Overnight&quot; (1987) from the multi-platinum ESP; &quot;Closer Than Close&quot; (1997) from Still Waters; and &quot;Man In The Middle&quot; (2001) from the Bee Gees 20th and final studio album before Maurice's passing in 2003. MYTHOLOGY also features the debut of a pair of previously unreleased Maurice Gibb tracks - &quot;Angel Of Mercy&quot; and &quot;The Bridge.&quot;\n\n\nThe final disc spotlights Andy Gibb, who was not a member of Bee Gees, but worked with his brothers throughout his career before his death in 1988 at the age of 30. The compilation opens with &quot;Shadow Dancing&quot; (1978), a #1 smash co-written by all four brothers that appeared on Andy's second album. Nearly all of the songs from his 1977 debut Flowing River are featured, including the back-to-back #1 singles: &quot;I Just Want To Be Your Everything&quot; and &quot;(Love Is) Thicker Than Water.&quot; The set contains &quot;I Can't Help It,&quot; a duet with Olivia Newton-John that cracked the Top 20 and several tracks from his final studio album After Dark (1980), including the Top 10 single &quot;Desire.&quot; MYTHOLOGY also marks the debut of &quot;Arrow Through The Heart,&quot; a song Andy recorded shortly before his death that was intended for a comeback album.\n\nDisc 1 - Barry\n\n1.
