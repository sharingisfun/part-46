I then extracted all of the pure WAV sound from the DVD VOB files and located the two seperate segments of dialogue I needed for this edit. Having spliced out the two segments, I then applied the necessary tweaks, which included time stretch, volume and reverb directly to the WAV audio. Once content with all the adjustments and testing for timings for the two overlays, I then mixed them into NuBreed's &quot;Oddworld&quot; production taken from their album entitled &quot;The Original&quot; in lossless quality also.\n\n\nNo changes whatsoever have been made to the Oddworld track itself besides an end fade-out. Everything was done in Sony Sound Forge Pro 10.\n\n\nThis torrent will stay seeded at 100mbit until February 2012.\n\n\n\n\nNew chillout selection for 2011 has been posted at:\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d3e962921c4918a5cc93c8215def391a9489a89","amp;dn":"NuBreed+-+Oddworld+%28The+Evil+Dead+Edit%29+%5BTMGK-EVIL001%5D+2010+320K","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d3e962921c4918a5cc93c8215def391a9489a89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,62,150,41,33,196,145,138,92,201,60,130,21,222,243,145,169,72,154,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
