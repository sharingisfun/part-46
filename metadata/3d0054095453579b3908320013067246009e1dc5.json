King\nNarrated by:  Jenny Sterlin\n\nMy preference would be to have ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œreadersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ consume these books in a sequential fashion.  Unfortunately I was able to get my hands on this book before the others.  I am working on adding to this Mary Russell library.  \n\nLocked Rooms is the 8th book in the Mary Russell series.  Story Line:  Setting sail from their adventures in India during the spring of 1924, Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes turn their faces toward San Francisco. The time has come to close up the house and business interests she inherited on the death of her family, ten years before. But disturbing dreams and painful memories make the visit more difficult than she expected, and Holmes suspects that there are dark secrets in his wife's past that even she is not aware of. A young Dashiell Hammett makes a cameo appearance.\n\nMary Russell mysteries\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tThe Beekeeper's Apprentice (1994) ISBN 0-312-10423-5\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tA Monstrous Regiment of Women (1995) ISBN 0-312-13565-3\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tA Letter of Mary (1997) ISBN 0-312-14670-1\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tThe Moor (1998) ISBN 0-312-16934-5\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tO Jerusalem (1999) ISBN 0-553-11093-4\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tJustice Hall (2002) ISBN 0-553-11113-2\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tThe Game (2004) ISBN 0-553-80194-5\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tLocked Rooms (2005) ISBN 0-553-80197-X\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tThe Language of Bees (tentatively scheduled for spring 2009)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d0054095453579b3908320013067246009e1dc5","amp;dn":"Locked+Rooms+by+Laurie+R.+King+%28Book+8%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d0054095453579b3908320013067246009e1dc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,0,84,9,84,83,87,155,57,8,50,0,19,6,114,70,0,158,29,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
