As he puts it: &quot;Almost nothing has been invented yet.&quot; So -- what's next?\n\nWhen Woody Norris won the Lemelson-MIT Prize in 2005, his official prize bio called him &quot;a classic independent inventor ... self-educated, self-funded and self-motivated.&quot; His mind seems to race toward things the world needs, though we don't know it yet: a nonlethal acoustic weapon that has been used to ward off pirates, a bone-induction headset, radar that can scan the human body, a tapeless tape recorder ...\n\nNorris' educational background is a key to his restless mind. He is not quite &quot;self-educated&quot; -- he's taken many classes, but always at his own speed and in his own style, studying the things he knew he wanted to know and working closely with professors. Ironically, it's a model that cutting-edge colleges are now embracing.\n\nHis inventions have seeded several public companies. Recently he has been working on the AirScooter -- a sort of propeller-powered counterpart to the Moller SkyCar. \n___________________________________________________________________________________\nplease leave a comment if you want, this is just to show what is out there...\nAnd before you go and spam, dl it watch it and make up your own mind...\ncheers the_phyrexian\n\nAre you a British citizen?
