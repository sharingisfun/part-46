Its one of if not the first horror movie.\nIt was made by Thomas Edison studios. Yes its that old.\nThere is sound but no dialogue of course.\nIts an interesting movie, but very short (13 minutes)\n\nInteresting fact:\n*when it was released it was banned because of how scary it was\n*For many years this was said to be a lost movie, like London after midnight so the fact that we have it on the internet is amazing.
