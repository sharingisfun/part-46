Her contributions to the 2001 project Voices on the Verge (think of a younger, hipper, and less corny 4 Bitchin' Babes) didn't mesh with those of bandmates Jess Klein, Beth Amsel, and Rose Polenzani very well, largely due to the fact that even early in her career, she was never a folkie in the traditional sense, yet her style was never confrontational enough to put her in with the Moldy Peaches wing of the New York anti-folk cadre. McKeown has since pulled further and further away from the folk (and even folk-rock) ghetto, and We Will Become Like Birds is a full-fledged, richly textured pop record in the tradition of Aimee Mann or Sam Phillips. Soothing acoustic and jangly electric guitars support McKeown's appealingly low-key vocals, with occasional touches like the electric piano underpinning &quot;Delicate December&quot; adding sonic variety. The songs are a varied and melodically sturdy lot that never settle for mere prettiness, with the hard-fought optimism of &quot;Air&quot; and the more downbeat moodiness of &quot;Float&quot; marking the album's emotional poles. The mixed emotions and soaring chorus of the Michael Penn-like closer, &quot;You Were Right About Everything,&quot; make it the album's highlight, but the entirety of We Will Become Like Birds is excellent; less bound by genre restrictions than ever before, McKeown has taken the opportunity to soar.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed61c541d1cee9e2004969a9ed7cf898e4b95c88","amp;dn":"Erin+McKeown+-+We+Will+Become+Like+Birds+%5B2005%5D+%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed61c541d1cee9e2004969a9ed7cf898e4b95c88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,97,197,65,209,206,233,226,0,73,105,169,237,124,248,152,228,185,92,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
