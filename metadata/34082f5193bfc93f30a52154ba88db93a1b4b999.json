Stan could lose Wendy if he doesn&amp;#039;t get involved, and Cartman would rather kill himself than join in on the fad. But when the boys realize that Butters is more popular than they are, they find that they have no choice but to give in to peer pressure.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34082f5193bfc93f30a52154ba88db93a1b4b999","amp;dn":"South.Park.S12.E13+iPod-+jB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34082f5193bfc93f30a52154ba88db93a1b4b999","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,8,47,81,147,191,201,63,48,165,33,84,186,136,219,147,161,180,185,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
