Meeting with Dr. Doom, bossing around his own crime family ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ anyway you want to cut it, Parker Robbins is getting big. His territory is growing like a wildfire, and you can't keep any of his boys in jail. But there's always someone bigger than you. Calling shots in New York is one thing...but calling them in Latveria, the Atlantic Ocean, and Asgard is another! Worse still, even some of the small fries are trying to edge out Parker, but there's a reason only one of these people is wearing The Hood!&quot; \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:819bbc093b69d4b584ba5a7a9507105a0ecb80fd","amp;dn":"Dark+Reign+-+The+Hood+02+%282009%29+%28Archangel+DCP%29%5Bh33t%5D%5Bttodddy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"819bbc093b69d4b584ba5a7a9507105a0ecb80fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,155,188,9,59,105,212,181,132,186,90,122,149,7,16,90,14,203,128,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
