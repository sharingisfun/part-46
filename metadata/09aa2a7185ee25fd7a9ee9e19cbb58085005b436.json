The film is also known as Nanking! Nanking! or Nanjing! Nanjing!. While originally slated for a 2008 release, the director-general of the Chinese Film Bureau announced in September that the film could be delayed to an early 2009 release.\n\nCity of Life and Death takes place in 1937, during the height of the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Imperial Japanese Army has just captured the then-capital of the Republic of China, Nanjing. What followed was known as the Nanking Massacre, or the Rape of Nanking, a period of several weeks wherein tens of thousands of Chinese soldiers and civilians were killed. The film tells the story of several figures, both historical and fictional, including a Chinese soldier, a schoolteacher, a Japanese soldier, a foreign missionary, and John Rabe, a Nazi businessman who would ultimately save thousands of Chinese civilians.\n\n\n\nAudio : Chinese mandarin - DD5.1\n\nSubs : English, Chinese\n\nR6 retail","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09aa2a7185ee25fd7a9ee9e19cbb58085005b436","amp;dn":"City+of+Life+and+Death+%28Nanking+Nanking%29+%282009%29+DVDR-sailo1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09aa2a7185ee25fd7a9ee9e19cbb58085005b436","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,170,42,113,133,238,37,253,122,158,233,225,156,187,88,8,80,5,180,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
