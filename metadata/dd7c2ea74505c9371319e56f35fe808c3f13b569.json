The story is set in Paris around the time of the Gulf War. Paul is an actor leading a drab directionless existence. He has an affair with Ulrika, a woman half his age. His wife, with whom he constantly argues, is pregnant with their second child. He does not interact much with his teenage son. Much of the film centers around the emptiness of his life.\n\nPhilippe Garrel presents an elegantly spare, lucidly eloquent, and captivating fractured tale of displaced idealism, spiritual resignation, and emotional inertia in The Birth of Love. Using extended, extreme close-ups that visually isolate the characters from their environment and also serve to reinforce their intimate, yet emotionally dissociated encounters, the film illustrates the ambiguous and indeterminate structure of Paul and Markus' lives as they struggle to reconcile with an idle intellectualism that has replaced their once determined, youthful idealism (note that the tangential references to the first Gulf War - particularly during the birth of Paul's daughter - establish, not only a contemporary context for the film, but also provide insight into the characters' melancholic impotence over their defeated ideology, a sentiment that similar pervades the lives of the settled, domesticated former revolutionaries of Alain Tanner's Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000).\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107652/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107652/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSubtitles: English, Spanish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd7c2ea74505c9371319e56f35fe808c3f13b569","amp;dn":"La.Naissance.de.L.Amour.1993","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd7c2ea74505c9371319e56f35fe808c3f13b569","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,124,46,167,69,5,201,55,19,25,229,111,53,254,128,140,63,19,181,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
