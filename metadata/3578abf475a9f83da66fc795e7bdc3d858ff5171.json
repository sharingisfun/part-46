The album was met with wide critical acclaim and contains two of Gabriel's most famous songs, &quot;Games Without Frontiers,&quot; which reached the U.S. Top 50, and &quot;Biko&quot;. It was remastered with most of Gabriel's catalog in 2002.\n\nThis album is often referred to as Melt, referring to the album cover by Storm Thorgerson using image manipulation techniques employing a Polaroid SX-70 instant camera (though Thorgerson has said that Gabriel himself was involved with the smudging of several photos from the same session, and he does not remember whether he or Gabriel is responsible for the cover's final look.)\n\nThis album marked the first reunion of Gabriel with a member from Genesis: drummer, and current Genesis vocalist (as Gabriel's successor), Phil Collins.\n\nIn 1989, the album was ranked #45 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s. In 2000; Q magazine placed the album at number 53 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written by Peter Gabriel.\n\n1. &quot;Intruder&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:54\n2. &quot;No Self-Control&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:55\n3. &quot;Start&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:21\n4. &quot;I Don't Remember&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:41\n5. &quot;Family Snapshot&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:28\n6. &quot;And Through the Wire&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:00\n7. &quot;Games Without Frontiers&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:06\n8. &quot;Not One of Us&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:22\n9. &quot;Lead a Normal Life&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:14\n10. &quot;Biko&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:32\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n* Peter Gabriel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals, piano, synthesizer, bass synthesizer, percussion\n* Kate Bush ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ backing vocals\n* Jerry Marotta ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums, percussion\n* Larry Fast ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ synthesizer, bass synthesizer\n* Robert Fripp ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar\n* John Giblin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass\n* Dave Gregory ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar\n* Tony Levin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Chapman stick\n\nAdditional personnel\n\n* Phil Collins ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums, snare drum, surdo\n* Dick Morrissey ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ saxophone\n* Morris Pert ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ percussion\n* David Rhodes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar, backing vocals\n* Paul Weller ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar\n\n\nMiscellanea\n\nThe song &quot;Family Snapshot&quot; was inspired by An Assassin's Diary, published in 1973 and written by Arthur Bremer, who attempted to assassinate George Wallace. Gabriel talked about the book in an authorized biography of him written by Spencer Bright and published (ISBN 0-283-99498-3) in 1988:\n\nAn Assassin's Diary was a really nasty book, but you do get a sense of the person who is writing it. Bremer was obsessed with the idea of fame.\nHe was aware of the news broadcasts all over the world and was trying to time the assassination to hit the early evening news in the States and\nthe late night in Europe to get maximum coverage.\n\nPhil Collins and Jerry Marotta's drum sound on this album (notable for its lack of cymbals) was a strong influence on Public Image Ltd's Flowers of Romance. Collins, in turn, was so impressed with Flowers of Romance that he hired that album's engineer, Nick Launay, for future recording projects.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3578abf475a9f83da66fc795e7bdc3d858ff5171","amp;dn":"Peter+Gabriel+-+3+%28Melt%29+%5BSAPGCD3%5D+SACD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3578abf475a9f83da66fc795e7bdc3d858ff5171","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,120,171,244,117,169,248,61,166,111,199,149,231,189,195,216,88,255,81,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
