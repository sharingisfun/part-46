It takes the       \n         viewer from the floods and droughts in           \n         Bangladesh, to dam building in India, water      \n         management in the Netherlands and the latest     \n         wake-up call in America: the Katrina disaster    \n         and the drought in the Southwest. Future wars    \n         will be fought over access to fresh water,       \n         unless we come together to face this global      \n         crisis. Without water there is no life.          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                            \n                                                          \n                                                            \n                                                          \n                                       \n                               \n                   \n                                                                     \n                                                                       \n     ASPECT &amp; STANDARD  AUDiO \n                                                                     \n         [ 640x480] Fullscreen      [*] English                        \n                                    [ ] Dutch      [ ] DTS 6.1         \n                                     [ ] French     [ ] DS 5.1           \n          [ 29.970 ] Framerate      [ ] German     [*] DS 2.0          \n                                    [ ] Spanish    [ ] DS 2.0 MONO     \n                                    [ ] Other                          \n                                                                       \n      SUBTiTLES  \n                                                                     \n       [ ] English     [ ] Swedish     [ ] Spanish     [ ] Dutch       \n       [ ] Danish      [ ] German      [ ] Polish      [ ] Italian     \n       [ ] Arabic      [ ] Bulgarian   [ ] Czech       [ ] Greek       \n        [ ] Hindi       [ ] Hungarian   [ ] Croatic     [ ] Romenian     \n       [ ] Slovenia    [ ] Turkish     [ ] Icelandic   [ ] Finnish     \n       [ ] Norwegian   [ ] French      [ ] Hebrew      [ ] Other       \n                                                       [*] None        \n                                                                       \n     ViDEO  MENU  DVD-EXTRAS \n                                                                     \n        [ ] Untouched       [ ] Untouched      [ ] Untouched           \n        [ ] Re-encoded      [*] Stripped       [*] Stripped            \n        [2] Passes                             [ ] Partial Stripped    \n        [1491] Bitrate                         [ ] Re-encoded          \n                                               [0] Passes              \n                                                                     \n      Rippers Notes  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n       Note: HQ sites needed: see contact info plz!                      \n                                                                       \n                                               \n                                               \n                     \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n         Greetz to everyone helping out the BD WMV and DVDR scene!     \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n     Special greetz to: TARGET INSECTS VOMIT SADPANDA SPiCE MHD MaxHD  \n                       Start2 QwiiF XorCist WiiLP NTX XPRESS THUGLiNE  \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                     R.I.P.
