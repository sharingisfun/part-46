The first-ever animated feature from Lucasfilm Animation, this \n\naction-packed space adventure follows the heroic Jedi Knights as they attempt to maintain order and restore peace during a \n\ntime of monumental galactic strife. The Clone Wars have engulfed the galaxy in chaos, and as the dreaded droid army of the \n\nSeparatists wipes out everything in its path, the future of the Galactic Republic becomes increasingly uncertain. Meanwhile, \n\nAnakin Skywalker and his Padawan learner Ahsoka Tano embark on a pivotal mission that pits them directly against the dreaded \n\nJabba the Hutt and his criminal minions while Count Dooku enlists the aid of Asajj Ventress and the rest of his sinister \n\nagents in ensuring that the young Jedi fails in his noble mission. Back on the front lines of the Clone Wars, Obi-Wan Kenobi \n\nand Master Yoda attempt to fend off the forces of the dark side with the assistance of a massive clone army. \n\n                            \n\n\n\t\t\t\tM P A A  R A T I N G  * * * \n\n\t                                 Rated PG\n\n\n\n\t\t\t       R E L E A S E   D A T E  * * *\n\n\t\t\t\t\t15 August 2008\n\n\n                           \n\n\t\t\t\tD V D  C o n t e n t  * * * \n  \n        Main Movie ******:\n         * Video - UNTOUCHED - 4688 Kbps Widescreen\n         * Audio - English, Spanish, French\n         * Subs  - English, Spanish, French\n\n        Menu ************:\n         * Yes\n\n        Extras **********:\n         * All\n\n        Ripped **********:\n         * Nothing\n\n\n        Chapters ********:\n\n1.
