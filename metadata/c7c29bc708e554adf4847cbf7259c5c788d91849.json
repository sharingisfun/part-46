The two tracks dedicated to D.M. van Vliet \\\\\\&quot;The New Reunion\\\\\\&quot; and \\\\\\&quot;Timeless Zone\\\\\\&quot; make a comeback from the last album \\\\\\&quot;Changing Times\\\\\\&quot; and fit much better into this setting, than the fast paced dancy predecessor. Perhaps this album can be seen as a more thorough way to express the loss.\\\\\\&quot;\n\nAlbum and track info: http://www.spacesynth.net/Artist/Laserdance/Ambiente-HS9104CD\n\n\nClose your eyes, lie down and relax!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7c29bc708e554adf4847cbf7259c5c788d91849","amp;dn":"Laserdance+-+Ambiente+%281991%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7c29bc708e554adf4847cbf7259c5c788d91849","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,194,155,199,8,229,84,173,244,132,124,191,114,89,197,199,136,217,24,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
