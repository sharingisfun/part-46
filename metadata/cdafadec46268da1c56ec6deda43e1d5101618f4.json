Yet we know that in antiquity the potting of the vases was held in at least as much esteem as the painting, and sometimes potters proudly signed their wares. This book analyzes the construction methods used by Attic potters in the forming of their vases. \nThe in-depth look at the techniques of pottery-construction techniques presented in this book is bound to increase modern admiration for the abilities of ancient Greek potters. \nWritten by a master potter, this is a book both for those who know little or nothing about potting techniques and for those who already have an understanding of these matters","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdafadec46268da1c56ec6deda43e1d5101618f4","amp;dn":"Athenian+Vase+Construction+%28Art+History+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdafadec46268da1c56ec6deda43e1d5101618f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,175,173,236,70,38,141,161,197,110,198,222,218,67,225,213,16,22,24,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
