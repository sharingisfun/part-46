In this cookbook, she recommends eating great food (no calorie counting) in small portions all day long. Her recipes come from childhood and from her travels and include reworked concoctions influenced and inspired by other cookbooks she loves. Angelou breaks the rules of what to eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner with recipes for meals to eat any time of the day.\n\nThe emphasis is on food so flavorful that whenever it is eaten, it is savored and so satisfying that small portions are enough. Among the recipes for creamy pork hash, chicken tetrazzini, Swedish hash, and oxtail stew are recollections from her life and commentary on acquired tastes and eating beyond physical fullness. In addition to the meat dishes are sections for vegetarians and recipes for soups and desserts. Gorgeous illustrations and extended commentary add to the appeal of this book.\n\nPublisher: Ran dom Ho use 2010 | 176 Pages | ISBN: 1400068444 |Ebook|23.5 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4d8361f7a3f338dd84545e81b432f32e9d767aa","amp;dn":"Great+Food%2C+All+Day+Long%3A+Cook+Splendidly%2C+Eat+Smart+By+Maya","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4d8361f7a3f338dd84545e81b432f32e9d767aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,216,54,31,122,63,51,141,216,69,69,232,27,67,47,50,233,215,103,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
