Leaving not even a footprint in the snow.\nTwo years later, alone and more or less permanently drunk, Anders returns to DomarÃƒÂ¶ to confront his despair. He slowly realises that Maja's disappearance is not the first inexplicable tragedy to strike the islanders. Nor is everyone telling him all they know; even his own mother, it seems, is keeping secrets.\nAnd what is it about the sea? There's something very bad happening on DomarÃƒÂ¶. Something that involves the sea itself.\nAs he did with Let the Right One In and Handling the Undead, John Ajvide Lindqvist serves up a masterful cocktail of suspense laced with bizarre humour and a narrative that barely pauses for breath. Harbour is also a heartbreaking study of loss and guilt and a novel whose epic climax pits the infinite force of nature against the implacable love of a father for his child.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41deab3924046c3ce6ac81b34fb733673735007e","amp;dn":"Harbour+by+John+Ajvide+Lindqvist+%28retail%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41deab3924046c3ce6ac81b34fb733673735007e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,222,171,57,36,4,108,60,230,172,129,179,79,183,51,103,55,53,0,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
