The album will be released in the UK and Europe on October 4, 2010, with an, as yet, unknown release date for the rest of the world. The album features a series of new remasters and remixes, apparently all overseen by Pink Floyd's David Gilmour. The cover art, featuring various images relating to songs contained within the album, was designed and created by long-term Pink Floyd conceptual artist Storm Thorgerson. It has been announced that an extra track for CD and itunes buyers will be the previously-unreleased 20-minute long instrumental Rhamadan.\n[edit]Track listing\n\n&quot;Arnold Layne&quot; (2010 digital remaster) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:48\n&quot;See Emily Play&quot; (2010 digital remaster) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:14\n&quot;Apples And Oranges&quot; (2010 digital remaster) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:03\n&quot;Matilda Mother&quot; (Alternate version; 2010 mix) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:14\n&quot;Chapter 24&quot; (2010 digital remaster) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45\n&quot;Bike&quot; (2010 digital remaster) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:00\n&quot;Terrapin&quot; (2010 digital remaster) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:11\n&quot;Love You&quot; (2010 digital remaster) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:49\n&quot;Dark Globe&quot; (2010 digital remaster) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:01\n&quot;Here I Go&quot; (2010 remix) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n&quot;Octopus&quot; (2010 mix)\n&quot;She Took a Long Cool Look&quot; (2010 mix)\n&quot;If It's in You&quot; (2010 digital remaster)\n&quot;Baby Lemonade&quot; (2010 digital remaster) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:10\n&quot;Dominoes&quot; (2010 mix) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:06\n&quot;Gigolo Aunt&quot; (2010 digital remaster) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:45\n&quot;Effervescing Elephant&quot; (2010 digital remaster) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:55\n&quot;Bob Dylan Blues&quot; (2010 digital remaster) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:14","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3766829cc5d6aae5cc5735c457f89d4040c50aa9","amp;dn":"Syd+Barrett+-+An+Introduction+to+Syd+Barrett","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3766829cc5d6aae5cc5735c457f89d4040c50aa9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,102,130,156,197,214,170,229,204,87,53,196,87,248,157,64,64,197,10,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
