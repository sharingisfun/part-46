The band's original name was\nthe Polka Tulk Blues Band (later shortened to Polka Tulk) and later Earth before becoming\nBlack Sabbath. The original line up lasted until 1979, after which Osbourne was fired\nand replaced by Ronnie James Dio. The line up changes would continue, with no line up\nremaining intact for consecutive studio releases. Throughout the changes, only Tony Iommi\nand keyboardist Geoff Nicholls, who also joined the band in 1979, would remain with\nBlack Sabbath, although Nicholls would not always be credited as a full member. In 1997,\nIommi, Butler, Ward, and Osbourne reunited, touring and releasing a live album in 1998,\nalthough a long-rumored studio release did not appear (the group attempted to record a\nnew album in 2001 with producer Rick Rubin but the sessions were scrapped). After that,\nthe group periodically reunited to tour with Ozzy's &quot;Ozzfest&quot; tour. In 2004, longtime\nkeyboardist Geoff Nicholls was replaced by Adam Wakeman for an Ozzfest tour. No reason\nwas given for the replacement. In 2006, the original line up was inducted into the\nRock 'n' Roll Hall Of Fame","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7a794c0938dc811423be893480f99d1ae3f7dbc","amp;dn":"Black+Sabbath+-+Asbury+Park+%5Blive%5D+1975+%28MP3-320%29+-+%5B%3DFaith%3D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7a794c0938dc811423be893480f99d1ae3f7dbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,167,148,192,147,141,200,17,66,59,232,147,72,15,153,209,174,63,125,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
