The game contains a series of                            \n             mazes that grow gradually more complex and even lethal to your marble. For                                   \n                       each maze, the player must tilt the board in any direction in order to make the                   \n                                                                                                                         \n         marble roll. The goal is to collect items on the board and then get to the finishing                             \n                    pit. Finish the board in the allotted time limit and avoid any traps, like falling off               \n        into the void.                                                                                                    \n                                                                                                                         ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d8a9233b0e68c30c799ccc31ff2dfd42ff2b855","amp;dn":"3D+Marble+Flip+%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d8a9233b0e68c30c799ccc31ff2dfd42ff2b855","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,138,146,51,176,230,140,48,199,153,204,195,31,242,223,212,47,242,184,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
