In this episode, the platoon travels to Fort Bliss, Texas - an area with a terrain that mimics the arid Afghan topography - to begin training as a mechanized force. Right from the start, however, 1 Platoon encounters difficulties, leaving Major Oberwarth very worried as the soldiers move into live fire exercises.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e76aaa69b44e66a62e5b6d3aced7f870528137b","amp;dn":"Combat.School.S01E01.XviD-err0001.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e76aaa69b44e66a62e5b6d3aced7f870528137b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,118,170,166,155,68,230,106,98,229,182,211,172,237,127,135,5,40,19,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
