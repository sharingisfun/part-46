The choice is not so simple, though, for her grandmother's cottage is an enchanting place where currant jam tastes of tears, sparks fly from fingertips, love's embrace makes apple trees blossom, and the darkest family secrets never stay buried.\n\nAs Iris moves in and out of the flicker between remembrance and forgetting, she chances upon a forgotten childhood friend who could become more.\n\nThe Taste of Apple Seeds is a bittersweet story of heartbreak and hope passed down through the generations.\n\nGenre: Contemporary Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07a781047fa27cc1e5a86c427c08b023390c5330","amp;dn":"The+Taste+of+Apple+Seeds+by+Katharina+Hagena","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07a781047fa27cc1e5a86c427c08b023390c5330","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,167,129,4,127,162,124,193,229,168,108,66,124,8,176,35,57,12,83,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
