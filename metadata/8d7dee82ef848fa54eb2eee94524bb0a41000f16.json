Make yourself a star quarterback or an arena rock star. Put friends and family members on $100 bills, or swap all of their heads and bodies. Funhouse walks you through adding your personal photos into built-in or custom templates to print, email, and share these digital imaging creations. Add captions, titles, quotes-full text editing lets you include colorful taglines and descriptions. \n\nPerfect photo blending for creative, fun digital images \n\nFocusing on simplicity and fun \nThe intuitive and easy-to-follow interface makes creating your Funhouse images pain-free and fun. The five simple steps are clearly marked along the side of the desktop. It's virtually impossible to stumble-the program stops you from performing the wrong step by activating the steps only when the time is right. \n\nPerfect mask creation \n&quot;Mask&quot; out areas of a photo to create your template. The masked area will be transparent so that other photos can be placed within. Comprehensive tools let you mask precise areas. Blur tools create effective blends so that photos don't look pieced together. Size and orientation controls let you position inserted photos for a clean, natural look. \n\nContent \nIncluded with the program are over 150 unique templates, ready to be customized with your own personal images. The templates are categorized into themes, making it easy to browse and select what you want. Templates range from animated cartoon cels to classic, historic scenes. Simply select the template you want, and then insert your own personal image to bring the photo to life. \n\nLive image capture \nCapture photos directly into your selected template using a connected and compatible video device. There's no need to capture your images separately, download them, and then import them into the program. With a few clicks, you can have a captured photo placed perfectly within a template. \n\nAutomatic and manual color refinement \nThe &quot;Match Color&quot; option automatically adjusts the hue and saturation of the inserted photo for exceptional blending. Your photo will really look a part of the template into which it was inserted. If additional color manipulation is required, manual brightness, contrast, and hue sliders are available and easily adjusted \n\nFull text editing \nAdd text anywhere on your Funhouse image. Adjust font size, style, and color. Add a customizable shadow to the text for an added effect. \n\nShare your work \nSave, print, and email your finished work. Share your creations with friends, family, coworkers, whomever. Create images for special occasions, gifts, or just for fun. \n\nSystem Requirements: \n\nWindows: \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Windows 98/ME/2000/XP \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Pentium-based PC or equivalent \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 150 MB free hard disk space \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 64 MB RAM \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 16-bit color display at 800 x 600 \n\nMacintosh: \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Macintosh OS 8.6/9/X (10.2) \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Power PC \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 200 MB free hard disk space \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 64 MB RAM \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 16-bit color display at 800 x 600 \n\nHomepage \n/http://www.arcsoft.com/products/software/en/funhouse.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d7dee82ef848fa54eb2eee94524bb0a41000f16","amp;dn":"ArcSoft+Funhouse+%2B+crack+%2B+Svenskbruksanvisning+pdf.Kul+prg+f%C3%B6r","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d7dee82ef848fa54eb2eee94524bb0a41000f16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,125,238,130,239,132,143,165,78,178,238,233,69,36,187,10,65,0,15,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
