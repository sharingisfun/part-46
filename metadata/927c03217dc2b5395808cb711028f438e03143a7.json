Jones reveals that, contrary to popular belief, the period was a time of splendour and laughter, not dreariness and servitude ... and that even dental hygiene was better than it is now!\n\nEach episode focuses on a different Medieval personality type or societal role - presenting the established beliefs.  Then, using recent research as proof, Jones turns these beliefs around to demonstrate that in fact they are little more than clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©.\n\nJones employs a combination of animation, self-acted recreations, and comedic narrative to ensure that a subject matter which otherwise might have been quite dull remains consistently entertaining as well as informative!\n\nTVRip\n256MB\n00:28:57\n\nVideo: DivX 5 704x384 25.00fps [Stream 00]\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 48000Hz stereo 128Kbps [Stream 01]\n\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:927c03217dc2b5395808cb711028f438e03143a7","amp;dn":"Terry+Jones+Medieval+Lives+08+King.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"927c03217dc2b5395808cb711028f438e03143a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,124,3,33,125,194,181,57,88,8,203,113,16,40,244,56,224,49,67,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
