In the cartoon, she was a reporter for Channel 6, and in the comics (in her first appearance), she worked for a scientist named Baxter Stockman, who was a recurring enemy of the Turtles\\\\\\&amp;#039;. She escaped from him when he tried to kill her for threatening to expose a criminal scheme he was plotting using his mass-produced \\\\\\&quot;Mouser\\\\\\&quot; robots. \nShortly after Casey is seen chopping vegetables with a sword, there is a shot of all of the turtles gathered in one room. In the bottom center of the screen, you can see a mic cord coming out of the bottom of a turtle\\\\\\&amp;#039;s shell and going down his left leg. This is Leonardo. Behind him, another more visible cord can be seen coming out of the left side of Raphael\\\\\\&amp;#039;s shell.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf37b03af001907ed746942119aa866a0f07d126","amp;dn":"Teenage+Mutant+Ninja+Turtles+1+-+1990+iNTERNAL+DVDRip+XVID","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf37b03af001907ed746942119aa866a0f07d126","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,55,176,58,240,1,144,126,215,70,148,33,25,170,134,106,15,7,209,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
