Seeking to squash the rebellion before it gains any more ground, vicious dictator Tomo Wolfe pulls out all the stops, revealing new monstrosities and abominable weapons that will push Orchid to her limits . . . or kill her.\n\n\nThanks goes to Tarutaru for this release.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8abfced0f0cab5abf9fa343b2e3223bd7417659a","amp;dn":"Orchid+10+%281440+%26amp%3B+2048px-HD%29+%28Tarutaru-Novus%29+%5BNVS-D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8abfced0f0cab5abf9fa343b2e3223bd7417659a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,191,206,208,240,202,181,171,249,250,52,59,46,50,35,189,116,23,101,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
