The program assumes that the location of the wordpad.exe is as under:\n\tC:\\Program Files\\Acessoreis\\Wordpad.exe - Windows 98 location\n\tC:\\Program files\\Windows NT\\Acessories\\Wordpad.exe - Windows XP location\nIn case, the files like `ReadmeFirstÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, do not display, please check the location of the Wordpad.exe file in your computer and re-locate the file to any of the 2 locations given above which are the normal location of the Wordpad.exe file.\nAldasa - Dasas/Bukthis/Antarams\nThe ALDASA program tabulates Dasas, Bukthis and Antarams from the current date. Dasas have been calculated on the basis of 365.2422 days a year. Because of rounding of the dates, a difference of one or 2 days may be noticed between ending of Dasas, Bukthis and Antarams. This difference is not important astrologically. \nThe tabulation covers the period up to an age of 100. If a person is 80 and starts the program, he will get results for the next 20/25 years. If the program is initiated when a child is born, dasas, bukthis and antarams will be tabulated for about 100 years. The results are saved in a `TextÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ file and the location is given. The results can be perused at any time by finding the file using the Windows Explorer and double clicking the file icon. It can also be printed completely or portions can be printed selectively.\nReadmeFirst \nAll the Programs contain a `ReadmeFirstÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ button.
