The album was released in the year 1985 on the label Atco Records in the US, peaking at #26, and was reissued on the label Hip-O Records in 2006.   &quot;White City: A Novel&quot; is also Pete Townshend's fourth solo album which initially achieved gold status by the RIAA in the U.S. on 22 January 1986.\n\nFree of The Who for the first time in over twenty years and taking on concerns that he had run into in his personal life, White City: A Novel, is a good effort by one of rocks all time great songwriters. Uneven in some places and vague in others, it manages to hold its head above water on the strength of the skilled storytelling of the songwriter and skillful playing of the players and despite its sometimes weighty subject matter, never gets bogged down or preachy. A knowing, compelling, and perhaps most of all compassionate work, it would be Townshend's last album to date that has not left one wanting more out of the artist or scratching your head in confusion. And it's a worthy closer in a trio of solo records starting with Empty Glass that can stand alongside Pete's best and better work.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written by Pete Townshend except as noted.\n\nNo. \tTitle \t\t\t\t\tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Give Blood&quot;   \t\t\t\t5:44\n2. \t&quot;Brilliant Blues&quot;   \t\t\t3:06\n3. \t&quot;Face the Face&quot;   \t\t\t5:51\n4. \t&quot;Hiding Out&quot;   \t\t\t\t3:00\n5. \t&quot;Secondhand Love&quot;   \t\t\t4:12\n6. \t&quot;Crashing By Design&quot;   \t\t\t3:14\n7. \t&quot;I Am Secure&quot;   \t\t\t4:00\n8. \t&quot;White City Fighting&quot; (D.Gilmour, P.T.) 4:40\n9. \t&quot;Come to Mama&quot;  \t\t\t4:40\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b28f686451c23d763db6148ade3e7afc7db20c0c","amp;dn":"Pete+Townshend+-+White+City+-+A+Novel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b28f686451c23d763db6148ade3e7afc7db20c0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,143,104,100,81,194,61,118,61,182,20,138,222,62,122,252,125,178,12,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
