Known for her skills with herbs and respected as a Healer, she turned a deaf ear to the hurtful whispers of â€œwitchâ€. She and her brother, Randall were the sole heirs of their parentsâ€™ thriving keep and outlying lands. Even as a child, she rose to the task at hand so long as her brother was beside her. The problem was that her brother had been missing for nearly six moons. There had been no word of his whereabouts or for that matter if he was dead or alive.\r\nSir Erik Ragnorsen, a high ranking Knight of the Realm known for his prowess on the battle field and his unyielding sense of honor, had been commanded to marry the heir of du Montefort Keep. What he had heard about her was that she was a witch and a crone, well past the age of marrying. He did not want to marry anyone, let alone a magic wielding hag. Though he petitioned the king to retract the edict, Sir Erik was obliged to comply. With a sick heart and spirit, he would never forsake his honor and would do his duty as bidden by the King. Only upon reaching the du Montefort lands, Erik soon realizes that things were not as he had been told. The crone was nothing more than a young woman; a beautiful one at that. As for the other, well, Sir Erik could attest that he had quite possibly been bewitched by the raven-haired Lady Rhianna.\r\nWhen Rhianna learns that the storm she had been sensing was really a maelstrom in the form of a man named Erik Ragnorsen, she vows she would not marry him. Upon seeing the blond giant who rivaled the Norse god of Thunder, Thor, she felt her resolve crumbling. Not only that, he had been in her dreams; he was there when she dreamed of her parentsâ€™ demise on the seas that stormy night when she was just a child. Erik vows to protect the Lady Rhianna at all costs and his promise will be sorely tested when an evil baron decides to take her for his own. Amid lies and betrayal, Rhianna still dreams of the one who saved her so long ago. Will their love be strong enough to weather the storm that threatens to tear them apart?\r\n\r\nBook 2\r\nSometimes, even though it is written in the stars, the road to true love can be a rocky one. And so it was with Bronwyn, the feisty daughter of the Lord and High Chief of the Clan MacCollum and the handsome English Knight, Sir Andrew Brandham. Can they set aside old hatreds and distrust and follow the course that Destiny has set them upon or will their blossoming love be dashed upon the rocks by the tempest that rages around them?\r\n\r\nBook 3\r\nIn 14th Century Scotland amid Highland Feuds and Clan division, rugged men fight for their birthrights and their place in history. The MacCollum and Campbell Clans are bitter enemies, especially for the son of the Laird MacCollum, Rory, the fabled and lethal Wolf of the Highlands. When his betrothed is killed at the hands of his enemies, Rory has sworn vengeance on all named Campbell. Darkness pervades this warrior to the point of poisonous destruction. Each day the darkness creeps forth, changing him and embattling his psyche. Each day, the blackness is becoming harder and harder to quell. Only Love can save him from the impending darkness, but his heart is walled.\r\nAfter years of self enforced exile in England, Rory returns to Scotland to seek his own destiny. On his journey, Rory aids and rescues a young woman who is broken and battered from a terrible accident. Rory knows he has to save her. In saving her, is it possible to save himself? His heart gradually opens, only to find this woman is his most sworn and hated enemy. Amid lies and betrayal, can Brielleâ€™s love save Rory from the Darkness that seeps through his veins? Can her love prevent him from the self destructive course he has been destined to run?\r\n\r\nBook 4\r\nKiera Callum is running from a failed relationship and career. The Highlands of Scotland seem like just the balm to soothe her battered spirit. She never dreamed that taking the menial job as a tour guide would afford her to actually live in the main quarters of Castle Campbell. She also could not imagine that the Keep came complete with a 700 year old spirit. It seemed Kiera ran from many things in her life when the going got tough. One of those things was her ability to sense the spirits of those who had gone before. She had denied that gift her entire life because it marked her as a freak. Only now there was nowhere to run. Kiera had to finally face everything she had run from in order to help the trapped soul of a medieval man whose presence was the most vital thing she had ever encountered. She would have to learn to trust in the things that could not be explained. Things are not always as they appearâ€¦\r\n\r\nBook 5\r\nStep back in time to the beautiful Highlands of Scotland in the 14th century.
