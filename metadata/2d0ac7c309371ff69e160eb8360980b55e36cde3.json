This Torrent took [HOURS] of work\nand i still have yet to finish the Sunday one. Please also download all the folder.jpg pictures. I\nI took the time to add the picture for each artist from the bamboozle website. so this project\nlooks really cool if you put your folder view on thumbnails so u can see each artist as you\nlook through their music. I bothered to also include album art for each and every album so \nthat when you put it on itunes, all the pictures will be there. Also each song is correctly \nlabeled with the following: correct artist, album, year, genre (matter of opinion), \ntrack number, and all should be the right length of time.\n \nThanks for downloading \n-Yoshipupdude\n\nFor this torrent i only included the music being covered by the bands, not music from the \nbands who are doing the covering, as most of them are already playing at bamboozle day 1 or\nday 2. i didnt want to include full discographies for these bands b/c that would be crazy,\nsome bands such as the beatles or queen or metallica have over 15 albums. including all that\nwould be rediculous, so instead i tried to include either a greatest hits album and all of\nthe bands singles, all their singles, or just a collection of their most popular songs\n\nTHANKS TO DEMONOID USER FILLERUPJONNY FOR THE LIST OF MISFITS SONGS AND THE ENCOURAGEMENT TO FINISH THIS TORRENT LOL. ALL THATS LEFT NOW IS THE SUNDAY TORRENT.
