No title screen, just playback.\nGreat quiality. Click and play.\nMy first torrent! Cut me some slack!\n\nIf 10,000 B.C. had intended to be a comedy full of low-brow humor, it might have looked like this offering from National Lampoon. Adam Rifkin (the screenwriter behind UNDERDOG) directs, writes, and stars as Ishbo, a caveman who isn't satisfied with his low-tech life. His friends and family hate his practical inventions, while he lusts after the unattainable Fardart (HEROES' Ali Larter). HOMO ERECTUS is filled with the type of jokes that National Lampoon's fans adore, and it features stars such as David Carradine, Talia Shire, Gary Busey, and Ron Jeremy.\n\n\n\nAtticus07\n\nGuitar Songs &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://guitar-songs.info&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://guitar-songs.info&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6f063aa261b014d2f83ab8b2c0a5b625d5ef2e1","amp;dn":"National+Lampoons+Stoned+Age+%282008%29+%28MPEG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6f063aa261b014d2f83ab8b2c0a5b625d5ef2e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,240,99,170,38,27,1,77,47,131,171,139,44,10,91,98,93,94,242,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
