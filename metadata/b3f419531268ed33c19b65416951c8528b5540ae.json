Although it was critically acclaimed, it never reached widespread circulation like Sienkiewicz's later works.\n\nThe story revolves around criminal psychologist Egon Rustemagik and his investigation of a serial killer that seems to be targeting women.\n\nThis presently exists on TPB but is barely alive. Therefore, I upload it again in hopes of breathing new life into it. Get it, seed it, and all hail Mr. Sienkewicz and the original seeders.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3f419531268ed33c19b65416951c8528b5540ae","amp;dn":"Stray+Toasters+%28epic+Comics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3f419531268ed33c19b65416951c8528b5540ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,244,25,83,18,104,237,51,193,155,101,65,105,81,200,82,139,85,64,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
