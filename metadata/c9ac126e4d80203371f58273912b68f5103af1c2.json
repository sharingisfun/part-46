But no one foresees the horrific turn of events that leads him to quarantine everyone in the Capitol building.\n\nA terrorist group calling itself &quot;Genesis&quot; has unleashed a highly contagious virus into the building, and the only one who fully knows its deadly consequences is the president himself. Desperate, he turns to virologist Griffin Rhodes, whose alleged theft of the microbe landed him in a maximum-security federal prison. Griff knows he's innocent but is forced to barter with the government: his attempt at a cure in exchange for his release. \n\n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9ac126e4d80203371f58273912b68f5103af1c2","amp;dn":"Michael+Palmer+-+A+Heartbeat+Away+%28ePUB%29.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9ac126e4d80203371f58273912b68f5103af1c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,172,18,110,77,128,32,51,113,245,130,115,145,43,104,245,16,58,241,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
