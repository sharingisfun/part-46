Raised by the wise centaur Chiron and believing himself an orphan, Jason discovers that his true identity is not the only secret his guardian has been keeping. What he learns sends Jason and five of Chiron's other apprentices on a dangerous journey to save the kingdom of Iolcus from a horrible fate.\n\nIn a daring race against time, Jason and his companions must bridge yawning chasms, battle vicious harpies, navigate their way down treacherous rapids, and outsmart marauding centaurs. Surpris-ingly, Jason's greatest challenge comes from within, for becoming a great leader proves to be the most difficult task of all.\n\nIn another thrilling adventure that imagines Greek heroes as young men and women, Jane Yolen and Robert J. Harris explore the early years of Jason, before he led the Argonauts on one of the most famous quests in Greek mythology.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b287652c93a07ea2000b6d03bf8d6b9d954149e","amp;dn":"Jason+and+the+Gorgon%27s+Blood+-+Robert+J.+Harris+%26amp%3B+Jane+Yolen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b287652c93a07ea2000b6d03bf8d6b9d954149e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,40,118,82,201,58,7,234,32,0,182,208,59,248,214,185,217,84,20,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
