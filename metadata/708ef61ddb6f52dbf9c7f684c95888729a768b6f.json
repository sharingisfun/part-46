We build, and disseminate these visual tools with the hope that they will self-replicate, and take on life of their own.\n\nThe HivestoryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\nThe work of the Beehive Collective has three major facets: the Hive is appreciated internationally for its educational graphics campaigns, at a regional level for itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s stone mosaic murals and apprentice program, and locally for itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dedication to the revitalization of the old Machias Valley Grange Hall, a landmark building in our small, rural town. The Hive has been going and growing since 2000 , at full speed!\n\nOrganizational structure and compositionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\nWe are rooted in rural Eastern Maine, but are a very decentralized swarm. There are usually six backbone bees at any given time, with a current count of twenty eight total, and many other autonomous pollinators scattered throughout the Americas that have small pieces of the BeehiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s work integrated into their own individual activist effortsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦. and countless other folks functioning as individual researchers and storytellers!\n\nAt this point in our evolution, our organism is entirely volunteer run. No one gets paid, but some folks that have been more involved occasionally have their expenses of room and board covered by the projects they are dedicated to. We have no queen, and make decisions by modified consensus process. The priorities for our work are set by the requests we receive from collaborators, audiences, and our advisory beesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ aiming to stay flexible and organic enough to respond to current events, and mass-pollination opportunities.\n\nSome examples of the busy bee metaphor:\n---The Hive has now distributed over 55,000 posters, completely by hand (not sold in stores) over our few years of existence. Hooray for the grassroots!\n\n---Each year, operating purely on a donation basis, and giving over half away for free, we raised 90% of our budget from these interactions! We attribute this strange miracle to the desperate need for more healthy, and visual representation of the complex and overwhelming issues our society is facing.\n\n---Each year our little swarm presents narrative picture-lectures about globalization and the global justice movement at over 200 locations in the Western Hemisphere! All of these events were organized by grassroots, word of mouth, efforts. We receive multiple requests for our presentations every day, and have been scrambling to create a formal training structure to have more SpeakerBees available for this overwhelming response to our work.\n\nYes, the HiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s work is ambitious, overwhelming, organic, thrilling, effective, challenging, stressful and moving forward in ways we never never imagined. Us Bees are in the throes of an adventure that is constantly unfolding- consistently testing our own limits. So far, the return on that effort has been phenomenal, something you'd need to see to believe. We've learned to not take lightly the metaphor of busy bees or ants carrying fifty times their own body weightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ our one guarantee for wannabees joining forces with our swarm: NEVER BORING!\n\n\n\n---------About the CD----------------\ng r a p h i c s   f o r   t h e   c o m m o n s\n\n\nThis cd is anti-copyright!  We want you to use and reproduce these images, for non-profit and non-partisan purposes only.  HereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s what that means to the beesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nIn order to preserve the non-commercial integrity of these collaboratively made images, we ask that their use be limited to flyers, educational materials, magazine articles, zines, newsletters, wheatpasting, etc.  In the future we will most likely broaden the scope of mutual-aid, by encouraging their use as non-profit fundraising materials for other organizations, such as t-shirts, bumper stickers, etc ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but not yet. For now, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d like to take things slower.  PLEASE feel encouraged to write or call us to discuss your ideas. Lots of exceptions will help us figure out how to grow at the right speed!\n\nWe ask that if you are using this ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œclip artÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in a capacity where the artists would normally be paid for their contribution, that the same amount be donated to our collective.  Please respect that whenever a creation is put out into the world with the political statement of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œANTI-COPYRIGHTÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that the producers of the work still need to be supported in their efforts.  The Beehive is attempting to be as self-sufficient as possible by avoiding over-dependency on grants, or price tags.  We would prefer to rely entirely on donations from folks that appreciate the work we are doing to keep honey flowing in the hiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ so far, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s working! Please help keep this model swarming!\n\nIn order to keep the graphics widely available for use as representations of the issues they are depicting, we ask that you not use these images as logos for specific organizations.  If your group is interested in using the graphics to represent your work in a logo, please contact us, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d be happy to discuss this with you!  It is also possible to commission individuals from our collective to do custom graphics for your organization.\n\nAnother little heads up from us ANTarchists: these images arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t meant to support any specific political party.  Please use your best judgment about this one, and get in touch if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re unsure about what we mean.\n\n-- HELP THE HIVE PROVE IT EXISTS! --\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s super important to this process that you share with us a copy of whatever you make from these images.  It helps us understand what people are using them for, and how we could provide even more useful tools in the future.  Besides! WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re super curious as to where this stuff ends up! DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be shy!  PLEASE email or send us a copy or some other kind of documentation for our archivesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦  \nyour participation in this experiment is crucial for the cross-pollination, dig?\n\n\nThanks for listening, and enjoy!\n- the bees","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:708ef61ddb6f52dbf9c7f684c95888729a768b6f","amp;dn":"Beehive+Design+Collective+-+Graphix+for+the+Commons","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"708ef61ddb6f52dbf9c7f684c95888729a768b6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,142,246,29,219,111,82,219,249,199,246,132,201,88,136,114,154,118,139,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
