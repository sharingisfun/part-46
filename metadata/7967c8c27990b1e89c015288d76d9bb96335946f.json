Ethereal vocals, resounding with the stark intensity of the mantras, and subtle soundscapes of traditional instruments evoke a warmly serene, meditative ambience. A mystical space to connect and resound with the creative and nurturing aspects of the universe.\nLinga Bhairavi is an exuberant of the Divine Feminine - fierce and compassionate at once. The Devi, consecrated by Sadhguru in January 2010, greatly enhances the physical dimensions of life, material wellbeing and health. The Linga Bhairavi Temple is located at the southwest corner of the Dhyanalinga Temple Complex, Velliangiri Foothills, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India.\n\n\n[IMG]http://www.india.ishashoppe.com/Resources/12e14cbb-6602-4d3a-8560-5e4042042938/Images/ProductImages/Large/Ye-Devi-Audio-CD.jpg[/IMG]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7967c8c27990b1e89c015288d76d9bb96335946f","amp;dn":"Ye+Devi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7967c8c27990b1e89c015288d76d9bb96335946f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,103,200,194,121,144,177,232,156,1,82,136,215,109,155,185,99,53,148,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
