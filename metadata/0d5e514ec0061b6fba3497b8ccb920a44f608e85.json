Henson collaborated on the screenwriting with children's author Dennis Lee and Monty Python alumnus Terry Jones.\n\nThe film stars David Bowie as Jareth the Goblin King, and Jennifer Connelly as Sarah Williams. The plot revolves around Sarah's quest to rescue her little brother, Toby, from Jareth while trapped in an enormous otherworldly maze. Most of the other significant roles are played by puppets or by a combination of puppetry and human performance. It was shot on location in New York and at Elstree Studios and Hampstead Heath in the UK. It was the last feature film directed by Henson before his death in 1990.\n\n\n\n\nConverted from AVI file to MP4 for iPods, Zunes and PSPs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d5e514ec0061b6fba3497b8ccb920a44f608e85","amp;dn":"Labyrinth+%281986%29+%28iPod%2C+PSP%2C+Zune%29+mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d5e514ec0061b6fba3497b8ccb920a44f608e85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,94,81,78,192,6,27,111,186,52,151,184,204,185,32,164,79,96,142,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
