I believe in continuously updating one's knowledge base and expertise, and as such, I am constantly refining my teaching methods. As such, these books are intended to represent my most polished developments that are related to Karate, martial arts in general, as well as fitness and lifestyle. Keep in mind that these books are not meant to be comprehensive texts. Consult your physician before starting an exercise program, and be sure to contact a certified fitness trainer to help you discover a nutrition and exercise plan that suits your lifestyle and individual needs.
