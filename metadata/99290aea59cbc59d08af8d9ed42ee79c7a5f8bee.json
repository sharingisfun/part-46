The music is however so tremendously good, that I really had to share this. It was not found on Pirate Bay yet!\n\nTogether with this torrent comes a few pictures that was found in the songbook and the labels; anything else needed, just mention it.\n\nEnjoy and help me seeding this beautiful music.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99290aea59cbc59d08af8d9ed42ee79c7a5f8bee","amp;dn":"Scott+Joplin%5C%27s+Treemonisha+-+Opera","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99290aea59cbc59d08af8d9ed42ee79c7a5f8bee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,41,10,234,89,203,197,157,8,175,141,158,212,46,231,156,122,95,139,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
