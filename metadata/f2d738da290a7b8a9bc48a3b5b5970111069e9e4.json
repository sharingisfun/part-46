But, shockingly, the war against Germany went on. Roosevelt, Stalin and Churchill had decreed that the German people must sufferÃ¢â‚¬â€and suffer they did.\n\nDriven from their homes, looted of their property, decimated by famine and disease, raped, robbed, and enslaved, millions of GermansÃ¢â‚¬â€most of them women and childrenÃ¢â‚¬â€bore the brunt of what Time magazine called Ã¢â‚¬Å“historyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most terrifying peaceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nGruesome Harvest was one of the first books in America to sound the alarm against the victorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s postwar war against the Germans.\n\nBristling with contemporary documentation, burning with humanitarian and patriotic outrage, this informed, riveting classic dares to tell the shameful story of how American and Allied policy makers undertook the political, economic, and social destruction of the German people even as they presumed to instruct them in Ã¢â‚¬Å“justiceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“democracy.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nToday, as the propaganda war against the Germans wears on in the media and academic life, Gruesome Harvest, written in 1947 by a courageous American, when the decimation of the German race was still official U.S.-Allied policy, tells a vital story, one that must not be suppressed or forgotten.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“If war should come, whichever side may claim ultimate victory, nothing is more certain that victor and vanquished alike would glean a gruesome harvest of human misery and suffering.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€œPrime Minister Neville Chamberlain, July 31, 1939, to the House of Commons","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2d738da290a7b8a9bc48a3b5b5970111069e9e4","amp;dn":"Gruesome+Harvest%3A+The+Costly+Attempt+To+Exterminate+The+People+o","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2d738da290a7b8a9bc48a3b5b5970111069e9e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,215,56,218,41,10,123,138,155,196,138,59,91,89,112,17,16,105,233,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
