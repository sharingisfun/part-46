He brings his students (including psychic McWhirter) to his home, one dark and stormy night to tell scary stories. The first involves a young couple whose car breaks down by an old, abandoned house. The second has four trendy teenage girls getting lost in a bad part of town, and chased by a pack of vicious dogs. Last, we have Helgenberger confronting a stalker at the answering service where she works the night shift. Written by Dzong A.D. Tranchina.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f740ddccb52a0bfe75b2d2680b927322e7843afc","amp;dn":"After+Midnight+1989","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f740ddccb52a0bfe75b2d2680b927322e7843afc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,64,221,204,181,42,11,254,117,178,210,104,11,146,115,34,231,132,58,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
