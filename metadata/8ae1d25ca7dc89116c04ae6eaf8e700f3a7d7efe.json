Marshall has been an extremely good interpreter of that &quot;vintage sound&quot;, the stuff out of the late 50's and early 60's that made rock and roll a radio staple.   One of our modern day masters of the 3 minute rock and roll radio song.   Don't miss this one.\n\nTagged, but no logs.  Enjoy, from your friend at the Old Farts Historical Society.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ae1d25ca7dc89116c04ae6eaf8e700f3a7d7efe","amp;dn":"Marshall+Crenshaw+-+Field+Day+%281983-FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ae1d25ca7dc89116c04ae6eaf8e700f3a7d7efe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,225,210,92,167,220,137,17,108,4,174,110,175,142,112,15,58,125,126,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
