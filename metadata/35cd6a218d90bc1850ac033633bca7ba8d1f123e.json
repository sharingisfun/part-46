Of particular note are the 15-minute extended performance of &quot;Dr. Funkenstein&quot; and the three-minute montage &quot;Landing (Of the Holy Mothership)&quot;.\n\n\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n\n01 - P-Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up) {Clinton, Collins, Worrell} 6:13\n02 - Dr. Funkenstein's Supergroovalisticprosifunkstication Medley 4:58\n03 - Do That Stuff {Clinton, Shider, Worrell} 5:14\n04 - The Landing (Of the Holy Mothership) 3:04\n05 - Undisco Kidd {Clinton, Collins, Worrell} 7:02\n06 - Children of Productions {Clinton, Collins, Worrell} 2:50\n07 - Mothership Connection (Star Child) {Clinton, Collins, Worrell} 5:53\n08 - Swing Down Sweet Chariot 5:06\n09 - This Is the Way We Funk With You 5:03\n10 - Dr. Funkenstein {Clinton, Collins, Worrell} 15:07\n11 - Gamin' on Ya! {Clinton, Collins, Worrell} 4:09\n12 - Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof off the Sucker) {Brailey, Clinton, Collins} 4:57\n13 - Night of the Thumpasorus Peoples {Clinton, Collins, Shider} 6:13\n\n\n\nCore Personnel:\n\nGeorge Clinton - Arranger, Vocals, Producer\n\nRaymond Davis - Vocals\nClarence &quot;Fuzzy&quot; Haskins - Vocals\nGary &quot;Mudbone&quot; Cooper - Vocals\nCalvin Simon - Vocals\nGrady Thomas - Vocals\nJeanette &quot;Baby&quot; Washington - Vocals\nDebbie Wright - Vocals\nLynn Mabry - Vocals\nDawn Silva - Vocals\n\nBootsy Collins - Bass, Arranger\nCordell Mosson - Bass\n\nEddie Hazel - Guitar\nGary Shider - Guitar, Vocals\nMichael Hampton - Guitar\nGlen Goins - Guitar, Vocals\n\nBernie Worrell - Synthesizer, Keyboards\n\nJerome Brailey - Percussion, Drums\n\nFred Wesley - Horn, Horn Arrangements\nMaceo Parker - Horn\nRichard &quot;Kush&quot; Griffith - Horn\nRick Gardner - Horn\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35cd6a218d90bc1850ac033633bca7ba8d1f123e","amp;dn":"Parliament+-+P+Funk+Earth+Tour+%281977%29+%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35cd6a218d90bc1850ac033633bca7ba8d1f123e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,205,106,33,141,144,188,24,80,172,3,54,51,188,167,186,141,31,18,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
