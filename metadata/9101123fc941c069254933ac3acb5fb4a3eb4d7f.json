Campbell (writing under the pseudonym of Don A. Stuart). The story concerns an Air Force crew and scientists at a remote Arctic research outpost forced to defend themselves against a malevolent, plant-based humanoid alien.\n\nThe film stars Kenneth Tobey, Margaret Sheridan, Robert Cornthwaite, and Douglas Spencer. James Arness played The Thing, but he is difficult to recognize in costume and makeup, due to both low lighting and other effects used to obscure his features.\n\nVIDEO:\nContainer: MKV\nCodec: H264 @ 872 kbps\nResolution: 640 x 480 (4:3 aspect ratio)\n\nAUDIO: AAC @ 128","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9101123fc941c069254933ac3acb5fb4a3eb4d7f","amp;dn":"The+Thing+from+Another+World+1951%2C+h264%2C+AAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9101123fc941c069254933ac3acb5fb4a3eb4d7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,1,18,63,201,65,192,105,37,73,51,172,58,203,95,180,163,235,77,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
