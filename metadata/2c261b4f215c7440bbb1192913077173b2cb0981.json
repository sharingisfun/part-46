What Bon had that his successor does not is an authentic bluesy swagger, and wolf- like howl. When Bon sang it, you believed it. This is real bar brawl music and requires a swig of whiskey and some Camels to thoroughly enjoy. These songs rock from start to finish, and with no dogs, this is just about as good as AC/DC gets. Highly recommended, especially &quot;Night Prowler&quot;, one of the best ending songs ever recorded.\n\nTracks Include&gt;\n1  \tHighway To Hell\n2 \tGirls Got Rhythm\n3 \tWalk All Over You\n4 \tTouch Too Much\n5 \tBeating Around The Bush\n6 \tShot Down In Flames\n7 \tGet It Hot\n8 \tIf You Want Blood (You&amp;#039;ve Got It)\n9 \tLove Hungry Man\n10 \tNight Prowler.\n\nLame mp3@320kbps.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c261b4f215c7440bbb1192913077173b2cb0981","amp;dn":"AC%2FDC.+Highway+To+Hell.+Re-mastered.%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c261b4f215c7440bbb1192913077173b2cb0981","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,38,27,79,33,92,116,64,187,177,25,41,19,7,113,115,178,203,9,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
