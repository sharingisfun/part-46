Written by Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe, the song was released twice as a single. It is a synthpop song, influenced by hip hop music. The lyrics focus on class, and inner-city pressure, and were inspired by T.S. Eliot's poem The Waste Land. It was generally well received by contemporary music critics and has been frequently cited as a highlight in the duo's career.\n\nThe first version of the song was produced by Bobby Orlando and was released in April 1984, becoming a club hit in the United States and some European countries. After the duo signed with EMI, the song was re-recorded with producer Stephen Hague, for their first studio album, Please. In late 1985, the song was re-released, reaching number one in the United Kingdom and the United States in 1986. In 1987, the song won for Best Single at TheAwards, and Best International Hit at the Ivor Novello Awards. In 2005, 20 years later after its release, the song was awarded Song of The Decade between the years 1985 and 1994, by theAcademy of Composers and Songwriters.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_Girls&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_Girls&lt;/a&gt; \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/OAbpKaAdA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/OAbpKaAdA&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video  : MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 9800kbps\n   Audio 1: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 256kbps\n   Media Length: 00:03:56\n\n (second audio track with commentary from both artists)\n   Audio 2: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 192kbps*\n\n*To change the audio in &quot;Media Player Classic&quot;, just go to &quot;Navigate&quot; then &quot;Audio Language&quot; and choose between the 2 sources (there's a delay that happens while the audio is switching between both sources)\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
