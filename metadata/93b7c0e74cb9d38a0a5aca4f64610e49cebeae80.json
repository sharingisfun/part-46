The island is beyond international jurisdiction. Lee, Roper, and Williams each have their own reasons for entering the tournament, but they all find themselves at odds with their host, the mysterious Han. \nLee is recruited by an intelligence agency to investigate Han&amp;#039;s operations using his participation in the tournament as cover. Since Han forbids firearms on the island, Lee&amp;#039;s martial arts skills could prove vital in case of trouble. Lee also has more personal reasons for dealing with Han, who left Lee&amp;#039;s Shaolin temple in disgrace and whose bodyguard, Oharra, was responsible for the death of LeeÃƒÂ¢??s sister.\nRoper and Williams are former army buddies who have had to leave the U.S. in a hurry. Gambler Roper has gotten himself into trouble with the mob, and Williams has assaulted a pair of racist policemen and stolen their car to make his getaway. Han&amp;#039;s island, beyond international jurisdiction, provides a convenient place for them to lay low.\nOver the course of the tournament, the protagonists discover that Han uses his tournament as a front to recruit new talent for his drug running and prostitution operations ÃƒÂ¢?? and once they know the truth, Han will give them but one choice: Join him or die fighting. However, he may have underestimated just how talented these fighters are...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93b7c0e74cb9d38a0a5aca4f64610e49cebeae80","amp;dn":"Enter+the+Dragon+%281973%29+DVDRip.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93b7c0e74cb9d38a0a5aca4f64610e49cebeae80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,183,192,231,76,185,211,138,10,90,202,79,100,97,14,73,206,190,174,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
