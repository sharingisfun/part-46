However, while DOTR featured a railroading GM herding a bunch of bored Munchkin players with an iron fist, Darths &amp; Droids has a more tolerant GM, who's willing to let the players get Off the Rails and contribute to the development of the setting, if that's what it takes to have a fun and interesting game. Indeed, the very plot of Star Wars, with all its inconsistencies and bizarre leaps of logic, comes along because the players constantly force the GM to improvise.\n\nFor more episodes of darthsanddroids you can click the link included in the torrent or go straight to http://darthsanddroids.net/\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nPS: If you want to request a comic, please make a post here: https://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=51\nand add as title something like [scanlation] title_of_comic.\nIt makes it easier for me to keep track of requests :P\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nNote:\n\nIf you never read E-comics before, you should download a program like ComicRack, (you can find that here: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Viewers/ComicRack.shtml).\nThen, you can use &quot;.cbr files and open them with ComicRack.\nIt's easy to use, and has a great quality!\n\nHope you enjoy!\t\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor other comics, you can check my release thread:        &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=112889.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=112889.&lt;/a&gt;\nHere the most recent versions of the torrents will be referenced.
