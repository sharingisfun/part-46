To her utter mortification, Quinn Sullivan- aka Sir McHotpants- witnesses it all then keeps turning up like a pair of shoes you lust after but can't afford. The last thing she expects is for Quinn- the focus of her slightly, albeit harmless, stalkerish tendencies- to make her an offer she can't refuse.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:101ca2a9952d4c28f35554d535de7d1dee07ab94","amp;dn":"Neanderthal+Seeks+Human+-+A+Smart+Romance+%28Knitting+in+the+City%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"101ca2a9952d4c28f35554d535de7d1dee07ab94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,28,162,169,149,45,76,40,243,85,84,213,53,222,125,29,238,7,171,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
