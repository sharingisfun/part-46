Thi is their first studio album from 1968.\n\nSwedish psych/prog/jazz outfit rooted in the mid 1960's underground. Unusually for a band with such a name they were fronted by Polish ex-pat George Wadenius whose unique guitar style was key to their sound. The original trio format made 3 studio albums and a live album (plus contributions to a soundtrack work) before splitting up. All 3 members then joined Solar Plexus (9) (not at the same time). The reformation in the mid-1970's was more of a super-group also involving musicians from Finland.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:426f07c0e66c5068b5495723b4b138908fb39873","amp;dn":"Made+in+Sweden+-+Made+in+Sweden+%28With+Love%29+%281968%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"426f07c0e66c5068b5495723b4b138908fb39873","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,111,7,192,230,108,80,104,181,73,87,35,180,177,56,144,143,179,152,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
