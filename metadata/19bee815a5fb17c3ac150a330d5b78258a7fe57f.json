JohnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s natural curiosity to understand the hidden message takes him to places he never imagined seeing, and ongoing conspiracies he never thought existed. The more John gets involved, the more he is led towards mysteries that are beyond his understanding. The circle of people involved grows bigger stretching from west to east; each step forward is like a step backward.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19bee815a5fb17c3ac150a330d5b78258a7fe57f","amp;dn":"Clout+of+Gen%2C+The+-+Ahmad+Ardalan.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19bee815a5fb17c3ac150a330d5b78258a7fe57f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,190,232,21,165,251,23,195,172,21,10,51,13,91,120,37,138,127,229,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
