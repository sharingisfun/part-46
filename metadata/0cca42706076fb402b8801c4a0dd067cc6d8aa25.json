All Technetium aspects such as\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· natural and artificial occurence in the environment,\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· isotopes and isomers,\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· analytical chemistry and electrochemistry,\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· thermodynamic data, stability and reactivity,\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· intermetallic and binary compounds, and predominantly\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· complex chemistry, and\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· radiopharmacy\nare presented in an clear and precise manner. This outstanding presentation allows both experts and non-experts a quick access to the subject. Therefore this handbook is an indispensable reference for researchers at universities and research centers, in the nuclear medicine and radiopharmaceutical industries as well as consultants in government and environmental agencies.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 446 pages\n    * Publisher: Wiley-VCH; 1st edition (May 15, 2000)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 3527294961\n    * ISBN-13: 978-3527294961","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cca42706076fb402b8801c4a0dd067cc6d8aa25","amp;dn":"Technetium%3A+Chemistry+and+Radiopharmaceutical+Applications+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cca42706076fb402b8801c4a0dd067cc6d8aa25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,202,66,112,96,118,251,64,43,136,1,196,160,221,6,124,198,216,170,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
