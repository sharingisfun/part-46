The album's title was a reference to the supposed melting point of rock. The album introduced the classic '80s Bon Jovi logo that would later on be used in Slippery When Wet and New Jersey.\n\nThe album recorded in six weeks between January and March 1985 at the Warehouse Studios in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The album marked the final collaboration between Bon Jovi and producer Lance Quinn.\n\n7800Ã‚Â° Fahrenheit reached #37 on the Billboard 200 albums chart and was the group's first record to be certified gold in the US. It remained charted for 85 weeks and was certified platinum on February 19, 1987. \n\nThe singles &quot;In and Out of Love&quot; and &quot;Only Lonely&quot; both charted on the Billboard Hot 100. Despite being a fan favorite, the band was unsatisfied with the sound of the album, and before 2010's Circle Tour, hadn't played a song off the album live since 1987, excluding rare performances of &quot;Tokyo Road&quot;.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \nNo. \t \t\n1. \t&quot;In and Out of Love&quot;   \t\t     4:26\n2. \t&quot;The Price of Love&quot;          \t     4:14\n3. \t&quot;Only Lonely&quot;   \t \t     5:02\n4. \t&quot;King of the Mountain&quot;   \t     3:54\n5. \t&quot;Silent Night&quot;   \t\t     5:08\n6. \t&quot;Tokyo Road&quot;   \t                     5:42\n7. \t&quot;The Hardest Part Is the Night&quot;      4:25\n8. \t&quot;Always Run to You&quot;   \t             5:00\n9. \t&quot;(I Don't Wanna Fall) To the Fire&quot;   4:28\n10. \t&quot;Secret Dreams&quot;   \t\t     4:54\t\n11. \t&quot;In and Out of Love (Live version)&quot;  12:17 \t \n12. \t&quot;Only Lonely (Live version)&quot;  \t     6:37\n13. \t&quot;Tokyo Road (Live version)&quot;          7:09\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db0305fc53c0f2a37e830f5bff37e874c5548da4","amp;dn":"Bon+Jovi+-+1985+-+7800%26deg%3B+Fahrenheit+%5B320kbs%5D+%7E%7ERenovatio%7E%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db0305fc53c0f2a37e830f5bff37e874c5548da4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,3,5,252,83,192,242,163,126,131,15,91,255,55,232,116,197,84,141,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
