But industrialists not yet alert to the threat of fascism reject him. A teenage ally caught up in his efforts is murdered. And the mission itself seems a failure. Yet neither the story nor Denard will stop there. Charles Boyer plays Denard and Lauren Bacall is a jaded industrial heiress who assists him in this intricate spy drama. For her second screen appearance, Bacall took a critical thumping, yet her presence smolders. The film itself still satisfies, thanks in no small measure to James Wong HoweÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s atmospheric cinematography and the story craft of source novelist Graham Greene.\n\nCritics in 1945 liked Confidential Agent but trounced leading lady Lauren Bacall, suggesting that she was merely a pretty amateur who'd coasted to stardom via her associations with actor Humphrey Bogart and director Howard Hawks.\n \nLauren Bacall gets to purr a few provocative lines but reportedly didn't appeal as a bogus Englishwoman; audiences didn't go for the movie. It was pointed out to me that almost all the actors are cast against their own nationalities. Spaniards are played by Frenchmen, a Greek and a Hungarian. Only Katina Paxinou's accent could be mistaken for Iberian, and she already had plenty of experience winning an Oscar for her Spanish gypsy in For Whom the Bell Tolls. American Wanda Hendrix plays a cockney girl.Yankee Dan Seymour impersonates an inquisitive Indian national named Mr. Muckerji, a fact that sinks in only after his second or third appearance on-screen. Englishman George Coulouris plays, inexplicably, a meddlesome Englishman, ruining the film's otherwise perfect record.\n\nStriking, literate adaptation of Graham Greene's novel which takes its tone from Boyer's tired, ageing secret agent (in reality a musician) sent to England in 1937 by the Spanish Loyalists to sabotage a Fascist business deal. Shumlin's direction is inclined to be lethargic (a distinguished stage producer, he made only two movies), but is more than made up for by Wong Howe's moody lighting, which perfectly captures the twilit world of people living constantly in fear. A marvellous cast makes it a must anyway.\n\nBetween takes on Confidential Agent ... Humphrey Bogart is said to have kept a close watch on his new missus, here apparently plenty bored.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 780mb\nDuration.... 01:57:50\nCodec.......
