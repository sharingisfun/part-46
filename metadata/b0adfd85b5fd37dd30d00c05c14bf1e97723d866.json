Perhaps it's the fact that it was Jagger's 29th birthday that made such a difference. The energy and delivery of the performance is captured in an incredible &quot;line&quot; soundboard stereo recording. The &quot;wide&quot; stereo separation features Richards and keyboards on the left, Taylor on the right, drums and vocal in the middle, and horns split between the two channels.\n\n- Bye Bye Johnny- /Rip This Joint- /Jumpin' Jack Flash- /Love In Vain- /Sweet Virginia - You Can't Always Get What You Want- /All Down The Line- /Midnight Rambler\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0adfd85b5fd37dd30d00c05c14bf1e97723d866","amp;dn":"Rolling+Stones+-+Wel+New+York+%5B1972%2C+28th+july%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0adfd85b5fd37dd30d00c05c14bf1e97723d866","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,173,253,133,181,253,55,221,48,208,12,5,193,75,241,233,119,35,216,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
