This is a scanned US 5th edition of Fundamentals of Applied Electromagnetics.  If you&amp;#039;re too cheap to buy one of the paperback international editions, this is for you.  Don&amp;#039;t bitch about the pages being slanted or some images being hard to make out in black and white.  Like I said, the international version is like 25 bucks, and you can even take it with you if you have an open-book exam.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7f86e8134b1d1e5db5897f6990ac4ae5d60ad01","amp;dn":"Fundamentals+of+applied+electromagnetics%2C+5th+edition+%28Fawwaz+T.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7f86e8134b1d1e5db5897f6990ac4ae5d60ad01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,248,110,129,52,177,209,229,219,88,151,246,153,10,196,174,93,96,173,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
