The only thing wrong is that there should be more of them - only three tracks after 1969.  Essential for Elvis fans.  I think I posted these some years ago.  There are lots of new faces here since then so they're worth putting back on the tracker.  New scans for Box 4 as I couldn't find any and I don't think I ever got around to them.  Boxes 1-3 are the original scans I did way back when.  Completely new rip.\n\t \n  \t \t \t  \t \nSet List:\n\nVolume 01\n \t \t\n01 I Love You Because\n02 I Love You Because\n03 I Love You Because\n04 I Love You Because\n05 That's All Right Mama (take 8)\n06 One Sided Love Affair\n07 Lawdy Miss Clawdy (takes 1 &amp; 2)\n08 Lawdy Miss Clawdy (take 3)\n09 Lawdy Miss Clawdy (take 4)\n10 Lawdy Miss Clawdy (take 5)\n11 Lawdy Miss Clawdy (take 6)\n12 I Need Your Love Tonight (takes 1-4)\n13 I Need Your Love Tonight (take 5)\n14 I Need Your Love Tonight (take 6)\n15 I Need Your Love Tonight (take 7)\n16 I Need Your Love Tonight (takes 8 &amp; 9)\n17 I Need Your Love Tonight (take 10)\n18 I Need Your Love Tonight (takes 10-13)\n19 I Need Your Love Tonight (take 14)\n20 I Need Your Love Tonight (take 15)\n21 I Need Your Love Tonight (takes 16-28)\n\nVolume 02\n\n01 A Big Hunk Of Love (take 1)\n02 A Big Hunk Of Love (take 2)\n03 A Big Hunk Of Love (take 3)\n04 A Big Hunk Of Love (take 4)\n05 Ain't That Lovin' You Baby (take 1)\n06 Ain't That Lovin' You Baby (takes 2-4)\n07 Ain't That Lovin' You Baby (takes 5-8)\n08 Ain't That Lovin' You Baby (takes 9-11)\n09 A Fool Such As I (takes 1-3)\n10 A Fool Such As I (takes 4 &amp; 5)\n11 A Fool Such As I (takes 6-8)\n12 A Fool Such As I (take 9)\n13 I Got Stung (takes 1-3)\n14 I Got Stung (takes 4-8)\n15 I Got Stung (takes 9-10)\n16 I Got Stung (take 11)\n17 I Got Stung (take 12)\n18 I Got Stung (takes 13 &amp; 14)\n19 I Got Stung (takes 15 &amp; 16)\n20 I Got Stung (takes 17 &amp; 18)\n21 I Got Stung (take 20)\n22 I Got Stung (takes 21 &amp; 22)\n23 I Got Stung (take 23)\n\nVolume 03\n\n01 Milky White Way (takes 1-3)\n02 Milky White Way (takes 4 &amp; 5)\n03 Milky White Way (takes 6-8)\n04 His Hand In Mine (take 1)\n05 His Hand In Mine (takes 2 &amp; 3)\n06 His Hand In Mine (take 4)\n07 His Hand In Mine (take 5)\n08 I Believe In The Man In The Sky (take 1)\n09 I Believe In The Man In The Sky (takes 2-4)\n10 He Knows Just What I Need (take 1)\n11 He Knows Just What I Need (takes 2-4)\n12 He Knows Just What I Need (takes 5-7)\n13 He Knows Just What I Need (take 8)\n14 He Knows Just What I Need (take 9)\n15 He Knows Just What I Need (take 10)\n16 Surrender (take 1)\n17 Surrender (take 2)\n18 Surrender (takes 3 &amp; 4)\n\n\nVolume 04\n\n01 Surrender (takes 5 &amp; 6)\n02 Surrender (take 7)\n03 Mansion On A  Hilltop (takes 3 &amp; 4)\n04 In My Father's House (take 8)\n05 Joshua Fit The Battle (take 4)\n06 Swing Down Sweet Chariot (take 4)\n07 I'm Gonna Walk Dem Golden Stairs (take 4)\n08 If We Never Meet Again (take 1)\n09 Known Only To Him (take 2)\n10 Known Only To Him (takes 5 &amp; 6)\n11 Crying In The Chapel (takes 1-3)\n12 Working On The Building (take 1)\n13 Working On The Building (take 2)\n14 Working On The Building (take 5)\n15 Fame And Fortune (take 5)\n16 Fame And Fortune (takes 3 &amp; 9)\n17 Fame And Fortune (takes 10-12)\n18 That's Someone You Never Forget (take 7)\n19 I'm Your (take 5)\n\n\nRipped by Ozark and uploaded to Hunger City February 2012\n\n\nNotes From Elvis On CD\n\nThe first of a series of four wonderful boxsets in an outstanding sound quality.
