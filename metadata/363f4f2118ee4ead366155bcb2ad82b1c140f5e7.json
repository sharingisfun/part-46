Another highlight is Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bully, Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which finds Smith addressing the tormentor in question in the strongest possible terms. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Amaryllis is probably the most rock and roll album weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever made, Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Smith says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve always been a rock band, and I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to lose sight of that. I told everyone the album had to do three things: It had to show sophistication in the songwriting, it had to show musical growth within the band, and I had to push myself to go places lyrically that I had never gone before.
