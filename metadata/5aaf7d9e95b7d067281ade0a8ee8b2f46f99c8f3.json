This live album\n\nfrom 1965 finds him at his peak.\n\n\nWhat I like most about this album is the blues playing of Budd Johnson on sax.\n\nBudd plays on (5)of the tracks.  Track #3 CAVERNISM is a total &quot;GAS,&quot; as they used\n\nto say.  Half way through the tune Budd switches from Tenor sax to Soprano sax for\n\nsome inspired blues improvisation.  It's hard to believe that these guys were\n\nessentially jamming.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5aaf7d9e95b7d067281ade0a8ee8b2f46f99c8f3","amp;dn":"Earl+Hines%3B+live+at+the+Village+Vanguard+%281965%29+Budd+Johnson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5aaf7d9e95b7d067281ade0a8ee8b2f46f99c8f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,175,125,158,149,183,208,103,40,26,222,10,142,232,178,244,111,153,200,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
