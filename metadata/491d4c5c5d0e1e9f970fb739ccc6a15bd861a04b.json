Burn it on DVD or mount it with nero, Deamon or an other virtual DVD drive.\n\nHave fun!!\n\nIf you have any comments, shout it out :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:491d4c5c5d0e1e9f970fb739ccc6a15bd861a04b","amp;dn":"Star+wars+Tie+fighter+%28TIE95%29+collectors+edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"491d4c5c5d0e1e9f970fb739ccc6a15bd861a04b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,29,76,92,93,14,30,159,151,15,183,57,204,198,161,91,216,97,160,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
