Slavoj Zizek has identified the four horsemen of this coming apocalypse: the worldwide ecological crisis; imbalances within the economic system; the biogenetic revolution; and exploding social divisions and ruptures. But, he asks, if the end of capitalism seems to many like the end of the world, how is it possible for Western society to face up to the end times? In a major new analysis of our global situation, Slavok Zizek argues that our collective responses to economic Armageddon correspond to the stages of grief: ideological denial, explosions of anger and attempts at bargaining, followed by depression and withdrawal.\n\nAfter passing through this zero-point, we can begin to perceive the crisis as a chance for a new beginning. Or, as Mao Zedong put it, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThere is great disorder under heaven, the situation is excellent.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Slavoj Zizek shows the cultural and political forms of these stages of ideological avoidance and political protest, from New Age obscurantism to violent religious fundamentalism. Concluding with a compelling argument for the return of a Marxian critique of political economy, Zizek also divines the wellsprings of a potentially communist cultureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from literary utopias like KafkaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s community of mice to the collective of freak outcasts in the TV series Heroes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4280f52bb6bdf4d7cfea463bc75ecbc97df209b2","amp;dn":"Living+in+the+End+Times","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4280f52bb6bdf4d7cfea463bc75ecbc97df209b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,128,245,43,182,189,244,215,207,234,70,59,199,94,203,201,125,242,9,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
