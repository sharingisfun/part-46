It soon becomes apparent that they will not have to cope only with the forces of nature, but with the island's secrets, including the Dharma Initiative, the 'Lost Numbers', the &quot;others&quot; (or hostiles) and the strange black smoke- to name a few. There is also much more than meets the eye, as it becomes apparent that everyone is connected in some way and that everyone has a purpose to live on the island... and for some, to die.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5af288595b0be96b0fc1eaa1b002b54c7bf8140","amp;dn":"Lost.Complete.Season.4.HDTV-ArenaBG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5af288595b0be96b0fc1eaa1b002b54c7bf8140","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,175,40,133,149,176,190,150,176,252,30,170,27,0,43,84,199,191,129,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
