Like all the others he just extracted sounds from recordings other people made, and apparently that&amp;#039;s what he calls &quot;ripping&quot; eventhough &quot;rip-off&quot; would be way more accurate...what an attention seeking lame ass!\n\nFunny how he accuses ME of stealing credit (never did, simply uploaded a torrent here and GAVE him credit!) and then he releases THIS bootleg which I provided him with all the material for. Nice work, you double standard noob!\n\nWell, anyway....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e87cfd78d902063c3a23501a760e8baeffde3549","amp;dn":"Linkin+Park+-+Copenhagen+2007+%28Audio%29+-+T%7CK+sucks%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e87cfd78d902063c3a23501a760e8baeffde3549","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,124,253,120,217,2,6,60,58,35,80,26,118,14,139,174,255,222,53,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
