Known for their ability to put on a great show, Vertigo is always able to connect with a crowd, and bring that crowd to its feet. Passionate, energetic, and eminently likeable, frontwoman Lindsey Stamey is an absolutely awe-inspiring vocalist and entertainer.\n\nFrom hard-driving rock beats to a more ethereal and melodic vibe, Vertigo's sound is somewhere between Flyeaf and Radiohead.\n\nAfter having shared the stage with acts such as Flyleaf, The Gin Blossoms, 10 Years, and Shiny Toy Guns, Vertigo has the experience and ability to deliver performances that never fail to please.\n\nVertigo is a rare blend of musicianship at its finest, and entertainment at its most compelling.\n\n\nNow, however, they have broken up and have gone on their own seperate projects.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                    And Miles to Go Before We Sleep (2005)   \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
