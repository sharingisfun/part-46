It features three unique races [Terran, Protoss, and Zerg] that are pitted together in an intergalactic war taking place on the Galactic Rim. You as the player can take control of any one of these races to victory in single player mode, being rewarded by awesome cutscenes that are a Blizzard trademark.\n\nHowever, it is the multiplayer options that make this game REALLY shine. Blizzard provides its own FREE online service, Battle.net, and here you can meet Starcraft and Diablo players from around the world. The newly improved Battle.net will feature multiple chat rooms, a World Wide Ranking Ladder, and Online Tech Support! It`s definitely one of the best done online services out there.\n\nStarcraft features up to 8-player games over the Internet and Local Area Networks. Some of the multiplayer game features include:\n\n* One on One [Deathmatches]\n* Team [Two or more players controlling a single team civilization]\n* Melee [Free For All or Separate Player Team Play]\n* Capture the Flag [Capture all the enemy flags to win]\n* Slaughter [Race to see who can get the most kills in an allotted time]\n* Greed [Race to see who can get the most resouces in an allotted time]\n* Ladder [Ladder matches to determine World Wide Ranking]\n* And More!\n\nStarcraft is definitely one of the best games ever to hit the market. There is no doubt that Blizzard has done an excellent job on this game.\n\nBrood War:\n\nStarcraft: Brood War features a new ladder, single player campaigns, tilesets, SCX`s, upgrades, and units. The Brood War ladder runs along side the existing one, so players without Brood War will only be able to compete in the current ladder. There are no new buildings; new units and their upgrades will be accessed through current buildings.\n\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nWindows 95/98/NT\nPentium 90 or higher\n16 MB RAM\nDirectX-Compatible SVGA Video Card\nMicrosoft-Compatible Mouse\nDouble-Speed CD-ROM (Quad Speed for Cinematics)\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b00d0b335c79e1583f571453ac5da2d4368345b4","amp;dn":"%5BLAN%5D+Starcraft+%2B+Broodwar+1.16.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b00d0b335c79e1583f571453ac5da2d4368345b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,13,11,51,92,121,225,88,63,87,20,83,172,93,162,212,54,131,69,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
