This album, composed of various works Maynard made in the 1950's coming from the albums Dimensions and Boy With Lots Of Brass, is great all-around jazz trumpet playing.  Maynard's playing is fiery and energetic throughout and also has a lot of heart.  Most of these songs were recorded when Maynard was a freelance musician in Los Angeles.  The album opens with a tune he did with crazy saxophonists Ben Webster and Benny Carter called &quot;King's Riff&quot;.  There are a bunch of solos here but Maynard and Webster shine the most, even though Maynard sounds a bit unsure in parts (he was only twenty-three at this recording date).  Then, it moves into a Willie Maiden chestnut called &quot;Maiden Voyage&quot; (not to be confused with Herbie Hancock's composition which became famous but was not made until a decade later).  This tune is simply playful and fun, and Maynard solos in the upper register with intelligence and skill.  On &quot;Willie Nillie&quot;, Maynard picks up the valve trombone and solos on this pretty Maiden composition is a nice showcase for Maynard's trombone skill.  Following is &quot;Hymn To Her&quot;, which is one of my favorite tunes on this whole set.  It's cool jazz at its finest, and listen to Maynard swing effectively in the lower register before jumping up high to end the tune.  A great selection.  &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot; is a popular standard and a great song.  Maynard takes up most of the solo space with impressive bop playing.  Another highlight is &quot;Can't We Talk It Over?&quot;, which features trumpeters Pete Condoli and Shorty Rogers (I think).  This is a great big band flavored ballad.  The trumpet section is so tight.  &quot;Egad Martha&quot; and &quot;Dancing Nightly&quot; are cool dance tunes with great saxophone work and heroic soloing from Maynard, along with &quot;Pork Pie&quot; and the slower &quot;Dreamboat&quot;.  On &quot;The Lamp Is Low&quot;, Maynard plays more great valve trombone on a song based on a Ravel composition.  The trumpet section is tight and Maynard plays great trombone.  Lorraine Geller on piano quotes &quot;Pop Goes the Weasel&quot;.  On &quot;Love Me Or Leave Me&quot;, they speed up the tune a bit and Maynard plays it effectively, and all the players sound good.  Irene Kral (mother of Diana possibly?) sings &quot;Moonlight In Vermont&quot; beautifully, and Maynard takes a screaming solo in the middle after playing great lead trumpet, and somehow makes it sound appropriate.  On &quot;Easy to Love&quot;, a great Cole Porter standard, Maynard and the band swing and sound great, along with &quot;Wildman&quot;, which has an Asian influence in its bop theme, and has a great shout chorus.  \nOverall on this album, it's obvious Maynard tried his best to avoid the upper register and show off his improvisational and melodic skills.  This may be his most well-rounded album out right now.  On some songs, he goes more for the style of a Clifford Brown than that of his own, but still manages to keep his own voice.  Any jazz fan will love this album.  Highly recommended.  ~ JetTone12\n\nVerve Jazz Masters 52 - Maynard Ferguson Tracks:\n01  KingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Riff 3:15 \n02  Maiden Voyage 3:02 \n03  Willie Nillie 3:07 \n04  Hymn To Her 2:37 \n05  The Way You Look Tonight 2:58 \n06  CanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t We Talk It Over? 4:56 \n07  Egad, Martha 3:55 \n08  Dancing Nitely 3:47 \n09  The Lamp Is Low 3:26 \n10  Dream Boat 2:54 \n11  Pork Pie 3:29 \n12  Never You Mind 3:30 \n13  Love Me Or Leave Me 2:41 \n14  Moonlight In Vermont 3:46 \n15  Easy To Love 3:11 \n16  Wildman 3:13","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:865accd0916ac821b32110d368d2ffa74a9df891","amp;dn":"Verve+Jazz+Masters+52+-+Maynard+Ferguson+%281996%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+192%5D%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"865accd0916ac821b32110d368d2ffa74a9df891","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,90,204,208,145,106,200,33,179,33,16,211,104,210,255,167,74,157,248,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
