It is the first sequel to Ian Bell and David Braben's earlier game Elite, and is available for Commodore Amiga, Atari ST and PC computers.\n\nFrontier retains the same principal component of EliteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½namely completely open-ended gameplayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and adds to this realistic physics and an accurately modelled galaxy. There is no plot within Frontier, nor are there pre-scripted missions (as there are in its sequel, First Encounters); instead players explore space while trading legally or illegally, carrying out missions for the military, ferrying passengers from system to system, engaging in piracy or any combination of the above. As a consequence, Frontier cannot be completed or &quot;won&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½instead, players themselves decide what to aspire to and set out to achieve it.\n\nThe game has since been released as shareware and is available as a free download, although being a DOS game, users of post-Windows 98 operating systems may have difficulty getting it to run. Primarily this was because of the game using EMS type memory rather than XMS. The program EMM386 had to be configured to use it. Using emulation such as DosBox will get the official shareware version of the game to run on modern operating systems such as Windows 7, Windows XP, Mac OS X and Linux.\n\nHow To Install And Play:\n------------------------\nExtract the game to default C:\\ drive.\nDouble-click on Frontier Hi Rez (or alternatively Frontier.exe)\n\nN.B if you plan on installing to another drive eg, D:\\ or E:\\ make sure the update the shortcut &quot;target&quot; and &quot;start in&quot; directories so that it points to your drive.  \n\n\nAnother Quality Torrent Courtesy of Hyperdrive25.
