Two stories. One ending. \nTasked with carrying out her grandfatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s final wishes, Amelia Quinlivan flies across the Atlantic and sets off driving around the coast of Ireland, spreading his ashes. Once finished, she plans on staying at her inherited cottage in Malin Head, and she plans on staying for a while. \nAccused of a crime he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t commit, Daniel Byrne might not know where heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going, but he knows where heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been; and that isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a place he wants to return to. When the feisty lass catches him by surprise, every instinct tells him to run from her and save them both the trouble he will undoubtedly cause. \nBut love doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always follow the rules, and when itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth fighting for, will Daniel let his pride get in the way of forever?\n\n\nGenre: Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66b1ba7944c8de64f52583510c39474e8e90245a","amp;dn":"Danielle+Taylor+-+Where+the+Streets+have+no+Name+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mob","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66b1ba7944c8de64f52583510c39474e8e90245a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,177,186,121,68,200,222,100,245,37,131,81,12,57,71,78,142,144,36,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
