This baby isn't it, for reasons having little to do with the actual performances. Like, where are the dates and venues for these twenty-two tracks? \nAs rock scholarship, &quot;Recorded across the universe between 1987 and 1993&quot; doesn't cut it. The credits also give no hint as to which lineup ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the original five, the Use Your Illusion-era big band ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ plays what. As for repertoire, the avant-glam sprawl \nof the twin Illusion LPs is shortchanged (no &quot;Coma&quot; or &quot;Civil War&quot;) in favor of Appetite for Destruction, reprised almost in its entirety. And &quot;Move to the City,&quot; from the '86 Live?!*@ Like a Suicide EP, runs for eight minutes, too many of 'em going\n to brass and keyboard solos. So that's what's wrong with Live Era. Here's what's right: the contrapuntal bark and skid of Slash's and Izzy Stradlin's guitars; Axl Rose's supercharged bray, a blood-and-spittle shower of contempt (&quot;You Could Be Mine&quot;), \nparanoia (&quot;Out ta Get Me&quot;) and desperate measures (the Illusion II epic &quot;Estranged&quot;); the shotgun union of pop brains and death-ride metal in &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; and &quot;Sweet Child o' Mine.&quot; On a real firefight night, G n' R were thirty years of rock &amp; roll history, \nmuscle and bad temper soaked in diesel and vodka, and the stage was their bully pulpit. This set is a narrowly missed opportunity to truly seal the histori cal worth of the band's guts and glory in concert. But Live Era's master blasts are visceral evidence of a time when \nGuns n' Roses ruled the earth and every show was, as it says on an old gig flier reproduced in the booklet, A Rock N Roll Bash Where Everyone's Smashed.\n.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97ed20cf20859160dee01ad6306a84455d55dcc3","amp;dn":"%5BFLAC%5D+Guns+N%5C%27+Roses+-+Live+Era+%5C%2787-%5C%2793+%28with+bonus+tra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97ed20cf20859160dee01ad6306a84455d55dcc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,237,32,207,32,133,145,96,222,224,26,214,48,106,132,69,93,85,220,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
