Things didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fall into place as quickly as I had originally hoped, so here you have it now, a couple months late. What youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find with this one is a Ã¢â‚¬Å“conceptÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ album. At least a concept in as much as a compilation can be a concept. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an overlying theme... that of the Moon. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a loosely tied narrative that is held together through the use of public domain texts, video and Creative Commons licensed music. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also a purpose... to explore the need for a Public Domain and the importance of Creative Commons licensing. We also have a guest artist providing the terrific illustrations for this release. My good friend Rob Pitt (twenty3x.com), who I attended Maine College of Art with, has been gracious enough to donate his time and talent. He provided some wonderful illustrations that captured exactly what I was visually shooting for with the release. He also agreed to license his illustrations under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share alike license which allows for derivative works. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find these source illustrations in a separate zip file on the release page. Be sure to read the included text file specific license information.
