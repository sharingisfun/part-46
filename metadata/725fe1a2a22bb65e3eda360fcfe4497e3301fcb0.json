It offers a look at PE file structure and all of the \nresources in the file, and reports multiple details about a PE file (EXE, DLL, \nActiveX controls, and several other Windows executable formats). \n\nPE Explorer lets you open, view and edit 32-bit Windows executable files (also \ncalled PE files) with ease. It can open a variety of different PE file types: EXE, \nDLL, SYS, MSSTYLES, CPL, OCX, ActiveX Controls, BPL, DPL, SCR and more (including \nexecutable files that run on MS Windows Mobile platform).\n\nPE Explorer provides functions for disassembly and inspection of unknown binaries, \nmodification of the properties of executable files, plus customization and \ntranslation features.\n\nOnce inside, file structure can be analyzed and optimized, hostile code detected, \nspyware tracked down, problems diagnosed, changes made and resources repaired. \nPE Explorer Disassembler utilizes a qualitative algorithm designed to reconstruct \nthe assembly language source code of target binary win32 PE files (EXE, DLL, OCX) \nwith the highest degree of accuracy possible. PE Explorer also provides: an API \nfunction Syntax Lookup, Dependency Scanner, Section Editor, and a Resource editor. \n\nDesigned for inspection and editing of Windows executable files, PE Explorer \noffers powerful static analysis and editing tools for working with EXE, DLL, \nActiveX controls, and other executable file formats that run on MS Windows 32-bit \nplatforms. \n\nWhether you are an advanced computer user just wondered what makes an executable \nfile tick, or software developer suffered from hard-to-find program bugs, \nPE Explorer is the software solution that will make it easy to find the answers.\n\n\n\nYour Way for Viewing and Editing PE Files\n\nPE Explorer gives you the power to look inside these PE binary files, perform \nstatic analysis, reveal a lot of information about the function of the executable, \nand collect as much information about the executable file as possible, without \nexecuting it. \n\nPE Explorer leaves you with only minimal work to do in order to get an analysis of \na piece of software. Once you have selected the file you wish to examine, PE \nExplorer will analyze the file and display a summary of the PE header information, \nand all of the resources contained in the PE file. From here, the tool allows you \nto explore the specific elements within an executable file.\n\nBesides being an effective Resource Editor, PE Explorer also provides several \ntools that elevate it to Power Coder status: an API Function Syntax Lookup, \nDependency Scanner, Section Editor, UPX Unpacker, and a powerful yet easy-to-use \nDisassembler. With PE Explorer you can view and inspect unknown binaries, examine \nand edit the properties of EXE and DLL files, and correct and repair the internal \nstructures of any PE (portable executable) files with the click of a button.\n\n\n\nWith PE Explorer you can:\n- See what's inside an executable and what it does \n- Change and customize the GUI elements of your Windows programs \n- Track down what a program accesses and which DLLs are called \n- Understand the way a program works, behaves, and interacts with others \n- Verify the publisher and the integrity of the signed executable files \n- Validate the identity of the software publisher\n- Say good bye to digging through bloated help files just to hash out an \n  API reference \n- Open UPX-, Upack- and NsPack-compressed files seamlessly in PE Explorer, \n  without long workarounds \n- Special support for Delphi applications \n\n\nOne Program, Many Tools:\n- PE Header and Section Viewer/Editor \n- Fast Resource Viewer and Advanced Resource Editor \n- Exported/Imported API Function List Viewer \n- Disassembler \n- Dependency Scanner \n- Digital Signature Viewer \n- UPX, Upack and NsPack Static Unpackers \n\n\n\nWhat's new in PE Explorer v1.99 R5?\n\nGeneral:\n- Bugfix: Fixed UI errors under Windows Vista.\n- Bugfix: Fixed occasional deadlock when quiting PE Explorer.\n- Minor tweaks and improvements.\n\nHeaders Info Viewer:\n- Added the Characteristics Editor to view or set flag bits in the \n  Characteristics field.\n\nRelocation Viewer:\n- Bugfix: Relocations would not be displayed in files which had sections \n  following the Relocation section.\n\nResource editor:\n- Added the option to specify the processor architecture in the Manifest Wizard.\n- Bugfix: Fixed an error that occurred when the last item of a menu to be edited \n  was a separator.\n\nUPX/UPack Unpacker plug-ins: \n- Minor update.\n\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nPE Explorer runs on all versions of Windows from 95 through XP, Vista, \nSeven and Server Editions. \n\nMinimum hardware requirements:\n- Intel PentiumÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® or AMD K5 processor with 166 MHz\n- 16 MB RAM\n\n\n\nMore info: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.heaventools.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.heaventools.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;When using TPB please read these important notes: \n****************************************************\n\n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of \n    their capabilities (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not trusting \n    keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting antimalware-apps sending scanning-results to their companies can coz\n    keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n06- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n10- Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?f=34&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?f=34&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting &quot;TPB's Most Ridiculous Comments&quot;:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=30402&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=30402&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting my account*:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n*All torrents scanned with:\n1- Norton Internet Security  \n2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  \n3- AVG Antivirus Pro   \n4- Kaspersky AV Pro  \n5- NOD32 AV  \n\n...and also with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected by \n   other anti-malware apps probably are false positives!\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of PB members abuse their PB membership by intenionally posting \nfake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to \nfrustrate PB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less \ndownloadspeed etc etc. \n\nIt's in the benefit of PB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and PB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\n                                         \n* Status torrent at june 04 2009 - 02.00 CET: clean, tested &amp; working.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:725fe1a2a22bb65e3eda360fcfe4497e3301fcb0","amp;dn":"Heaventools+PE+Explorer+v1.99+R5+%2B+Keygen-Patch+%5BRH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"725fe1a2a22bb65e3eda360fcfe4497e3301fcb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,95,225,162,162,43,182,94,62,218,54,15,207,228,73,126,51,1,252,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
