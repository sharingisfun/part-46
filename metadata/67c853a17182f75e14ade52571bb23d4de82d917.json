It was shipped in October 1997. Uprising, at its core, is a typical real-time strategy game, in that resources must be collected and units built to carry on the war. Where Uprising gets its unique difference is in its control and perspective of the battle. The game is controlled from INSIDE your Wraith tank, letting you get up close and personal to the battle. \n\n\nGame disc is in .mdf/mds format - &quot;UPRISING.mdf&quot;\nNo-CD crack is included under - &quot;uprising_nocd.zip&quot;\n\nThis game does work, but not on Win7(or anything newer than Win-XP)\nThe solution is to use a virtual machine with an older operating system installed(or just an old computer with WinXP will work)\n(On Win7 i get a black screen, maybe other graphics cards will do the trick)\n\n\n1- download VM-Ware player &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_player/6_0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_player/6_0&lt;/a&gt;\nIt's very user friendly.\n\n2- download some older windows OS(if you have a winXP disc in hand, then just use that). I prefer TinyXP since it uses very little resources. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5388565/Windows_Tiny_XP_Rev10-eXPerience&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5388565/Windows_Tiny_XP_Rev10-eXPerience&lt;/a&gt;\n\n3- Create a new virtual machine using VMWare-player, give it the tinxp.iso you download from above and follow installation instructions to get that onto your Virtual machine.\n\n4- Get Uprising onto the virtual machine. A USB flash-drive works easy, just copy Uprising to the USB-stick, unplug the USB-stick. Click somewhere within the virtual machine and only then plug back the USB-stick into your physical computer. Now your tinyXP virtual machine should be able to see the USB-stick. Copy Uprising from that onto virtual machine.\n\n5- Follow the instruction from &quot;uprising_nocd.zip&quot; to enable the No-CD crack\n\n6- Run uprising.exe and enjoy!\n\n\n\nIf you are having trouble mounting &quot;.mdf&quot; files, you can use WinRAR to open the .mdf file and still install the game...you will however need the no-cd crack to play then.\nIf the game fails to run, tinker with compatibility settings of uprising.exe\ntry using the original uprising.exe (the uncracked version while still having the .mdf mounted).\n\n...and if anyone gets this to work on Win7/8, let me know please - thanks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67c853a17182f75e14ade52571bb23d4de82d917","amp;dn":"Uprising+-+Join+or+die","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67c853a17182f75e14ade52571bb23d4de82d917","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,200,83,161,113,130,247,94,20,173,229,37,113,187,35,212,222,130,217,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
