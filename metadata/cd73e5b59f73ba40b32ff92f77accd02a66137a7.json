The album follows 2004's wet and windy ambient Purlieu, its harsher, urban-themed follow-up, 2007's Vacuum Road Songs, and 2010's 'experimental series', a run of acclaimed EPs and mini-albums released on netlabels, CDrs and cassettes, exploring new ways of composition and production. \n\nLess conceptual and more free-flowing than the first two albums, Safernoc instead focusses on electronic pulses, piano and string arrangements, and slow moving melancholia, lending the record a more haunting feel and a return to a pastoral sound after Vacuum Road Songs's rhythmic textures. Inspired in part by some of Baker's favourite composers - John Cage, Max Richter, Edgard VarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©se and Gustav Holst - the album blends this almost neo-classical sound with more recognisable Second Thought ambience, field recordings and occasional forays into contemporary dance music. Titles referencing ancient Britain and its myths and legends, and the desolate moorland artwork on display alongside the album reflect the mood presented in the music.\n\n01.
