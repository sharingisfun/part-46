Ferris for NSW and Midro for Victoria. Of course if you really love your hardcore you won?t really care which side of the border your tunes come from, especially when the set includes an extra disc featuring a playable demo of ?Space Channel 5 Part 2? for your PS2 ? good for when the head starts caving and you need a little break.\n\nDisc 1 is mixed by John Ferris and begins with Dee Dee?s ?The One?, remixed by Green Martian. Given that there?s no such thing as a warm-up when you?re talking hard nrg, it?s a fitting start that should have hearts a pumping. Tom Wax?s industrial ?My Definition? follows, with the oscillating ?Infected? close behind. ?Insane? breaks up the pace with some vocal after which Cosmic Gate introduce some bounce with ?Exploration of Space?. The high velocity is maintained for the rest of Ferris? set ? feet are kept at a constant shuffle and his deft mixing and track selection make for a tidy hard nrg journey (?moskito?s included).\n\nDisc 2 by Jason Midro boasts tracks by Kai Tracid, Organ Donors, CJ Bolland and Midro himself. Early into the disc we are treated to some breaks with Blutonium Boy?s ?Brainshooter? with ?I Am Here? by Jay Walker upping the tally for trusty dancefloor fillers. Jam X and De Leon make sure you can dig it, melding nicely into Soundgrabber?s ?Acid Fighter?. Upbeat and energising, Midro?s CD begs for a night of dancefloor-oriented sweating. Driving beats team up with brain melting effects and evil basslines for a big night in, or alternatively warming up for an even larger night out. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b54cff863afe6010274cac30415c09a2425482cb","amp;dn":"Ministry+of+Sound+Hard+NRG+4+Double+Cd+Mixed+by+John+Ferris+and+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b54cff863afe6010274cac30415c09a2425482cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,76,255,134,58,254,96,16,39,76,172,48,65,92,9,162,66,84,130,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
