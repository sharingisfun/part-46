As the population shifted from rural to urban, the impact of humans on the environment increased dramatically.\n\nThe twenty-first century ushered in an era of declines, in a number of crucial parameters: Global oil, natural gas, and coal extraction Yearly grain harvests Climate stability Population Economic growth Fresh water Minerals and ores, such as copper and platinum\n\nTo adapt to this profoundly different world, we must begin now to make radical changes to our attitudes, behaviors, and expectations.\n\nPeak Everything addresses many of the cultural, psychological, and practical changes we will have to make as nature rapidly dictates our new limits. This latest book from Richard Heinberg, author of three of the most important books on Peak Oil, touches on the most important aspects of the human condition at this unique moment in time.\n\nA combination of wry commentary and sober forecasting on subjects as diverse as farming and industrial design, this book tells how we might make the transition from the Age of Excess to the Era of Modesty with grace and satisfaction, while preserving the best of our collective achievements. A must-read for individuals, business leaders, and policymakers who are serious about effecting real change.\n\n224 pages\nPublisher: New Society Publishers (October 16, 2007)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 086571598X\nISBN-13: 978-0865715981","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54df4d64aed5751b261d360bfbcde0ec4279debc","amp;dn":"Peak+Everything+%282007%29+by+Richard+Heinberg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54df4d64aed5751b261d360bfbcde0ec4279debc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,223,77,100,174,213,117,27,38,29,54,11,251,205,224,236,66,121,222,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
