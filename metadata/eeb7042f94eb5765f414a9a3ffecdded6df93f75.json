She was not so reverent on 2008's Blues Walkin' Like a Man, a tribute to Son House, and on the third album she considers part of her Mentor Series, she takes some creative license with Mississippi Fred McDowell on Shake ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Em on Down. One difference is that she actually met House and McDowell, which seems to have freed her to take a more creative approach. She acknowledges that McDowell's driving, repetitive playing also served as a challenge, noting that he played more for dancing, intent on keeping a constant rhythm, than with any sense of virtuosity. And while she has counted the number of times a given figure might have been repeated in a particular performance of one of his songs, in her own versions she has added solo guitar lines to the basic riffs and also included other features, such as overdubbed vocal choruses. She also has written songs concerning McDowell, such as the leadoff track, &quot;Steady Freddy,&quot; an imagined autobiography, and its successor, &quot;Mississippi Man,&quot; her account of meeting the bluesman when she was 15. And she has adapted some of his songs, switching gender on &quot;Good Morning Little School Girl&quot; (which she acknowledges uneasily as being about &quot;child predation&quot;) and &quot;The Girl That I'm Lovin'.&quot; All of this is to say that she has applied a fan and scholar's attention as well as an artist's vision to McDowell and his work, demonstrating that a tribute requires both.\n\nTracklist\n1 Steady Freddy (4:40)\n2 Mississippi Man (4:53)\n3 Kokomo Blues (4:01)\n4 Good Morning Little Schoolgirl(5:16)\n5 What's The Matter Now (5:53)\n6 Shake Em On Down (4:15)\n7 Worried Mind (3:43)\n8 The Man That I'm Lovin (3:40)\n9 Ancestral Home (3:11)\n10 The Breadline (4:21)\n11 Wake Up This Morning (3:30)\n12 Write Me a Few of Your Lines (3:59)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eeb7042f94eb5765f414a9a3ffecdded6df93f75","amp;dn":"Rory+Block++Shake+%5C%27Em+On+Down+%282011%29%28blues%29%28flac%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eeb7042f94eb5765f414a9a3ffecdded6df93f75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,183,4,47,148,235,87,101,244,20,169,163,255,236,221,237,109,249,63,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
