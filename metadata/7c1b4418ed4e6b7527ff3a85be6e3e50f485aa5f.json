With a flamboyant, larger than life stage presence and a party-hearty surfer dude persona (not to mention his acrobatic leaps, long mane of blond hair, and skintight spandex outfits), Roth was an integral part of Van Halen's meteoric rise to global dominance from 1978 through 1984. Born on October 10, 1954 in Bloomington, Indiana, Roth was introduced to music at an early age, via his father's affinity for Al Jolson, Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra, and Louis Prima. By the dawn of his teenage years, his family had relocated to California, and by the early '70s, Roth had become a major rock fan (Led Zeppelin, Black Oak Arkansas, Grand Funk, ZZ Top, Alice Cooper, etc.). Roth was soon singing in local bands, including the Red Ball Jets, who would play shows along with another up-and-coming rock band from Pasadena, California -- Mammoth. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFlac (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.10% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tRhino\nCatalog:\t\tPRCD 72941\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Don't Piss Me Off\n02.Yankee Rose\n03.A Lil' Ain't Enough\n04.Just Like Paradise\n05.Big Train\n06.Big Trouble\n07.It's Showtime!\n08.Hot Dog And A Shake\n09.Skyscraper\n10.Shyboy\n11.She's My Machine\n12.Stand Up\n13.Tobacco Road\n14.Easy Street\n15.California Girls\n16.Just A Gigolo/I Ain't Got Nobody\n17.Sensible Shoes\n18.Goin' Crazy!\n19.Ladies' Night In Buffalo\n20.Land's Edge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c1b4418ed4e6b7527ff3a85be6e3e50f485aa5f","amp;dn":"David+Lee+Roth+-+The+Best+%281997%29+FLAC+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c1b4418ed4e6b7527ff3a85be6e3e50f485aa5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,27,68,24,237,78,107,117,39,255,58,133,190,110,62,80,244,133,170,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
