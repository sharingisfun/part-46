Now is almost 300mb less and video quality is same. For most people is impossible to understand Glaswegian accent, even in English speaking countries.\n\n\n\nExplanation for subtitle. I'm not trying to be some 'smartass'. This is of course for people who don't know about this. Subtitle is good, helpful, believe me. :)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is proper subtitle in English-English because is really hard to understand Glaswegian-English. Subtitle is if I may say 'gist of the conversation-proper\ntranscript' of what they are saying. If someone would write what they are really saying you might be even more confused. Basically they cut one sentence to one or two words. For example: &quot;Come on, then&quot; is simply &quot;Mon' en&quot;. Or &quot;Aye, a'll (I'll) burst' ya wee (little-short) man&quot;, &quot;Awright, big (my friend) man?&quot; &quot;Awright big man, lookin' for a swalley, ye, nee danger&quot; in some cases may refer to, for example: &quot;Ok, my friend, so, you looking for some bars, no problem, I will help you&quot;. It's mind-blowing accent to understand, but I liked it even more than English-English. :) Enjoy!\n\n\nPLOT:\n--------\nFollowing his Cannes award-winning performance in Ken Loach's My Name is Joe, Scottish actor Peter Mullan made his feature script and directorial debut with this British dark comedy-drama about four adult siblings on the eve of their mother's funeral in Glasgow. Eldest son Thomas (Gary Lewis) offers a tribute to her in a local pub, but his brother Michael (Douglas Henshall) is stabbed during a brawl at the bar, prompting third brother John (Stephen Cole) to seek vengeance. Michael evades medical treatment, trying to hold out until the next day in order to make a claim for workers compensation. Thomas leaves to join sister Sheila (Rosemarie Stevenson), who has cerebral palsy, in a night-long chapel vigil. The four attempt to reunite after they are separated when the full fury of a violent storm hits the town. Shown at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\n\nGeneral\n------------\nFormat : AVI\nFormat/Info : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size : 1.14 GiB\nDuration : 1h 41mn\nOverall bit rate : 1604 Kbps\nWriting application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.3\nWriting library : VirtualDub build 35491\n\n\nVideo\n----------\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP : 1\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Custom\nCodec ID : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 41mn\nBit rate : 1466 Kbps\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 400 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nCompression mode : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.204\nStream size : 1.04 GiB (91%)\nWriting library : XviD 65\n\n\nAudio\n-------------\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness : Big\nCodec ID : 2000\nDuration : 1h 41mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 93.2 MiB (8%)\nAlignment : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration : 512 ms\nLanguage : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03ab233c26a8b07cefd15d900b34f21805611a8d","amp;dn":"Orphans+1998+DVDRip+XviD+AC3+titler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03ab233c26a8b07cefd15d900b34f21805611a8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,171,35,60,38,168,176,124,239,209,93,144,11,52,242,24,5,97,26,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
