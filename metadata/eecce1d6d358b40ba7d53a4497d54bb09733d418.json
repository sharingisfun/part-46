Mumbling through &quot;Sh-Boom,&quot; Freberg drags &quot;The Great Pretender&quot; snarling to &quot;The Heartbreak Hotel,&quot; snares &quot;The Yellow Rose of Texas,&quot; and takes Harry Belafonte's famous &quot;Banana Boat&quot; sniffling down Lonnie Donnegan's &quot;Rock Island Line.&quot; Along the way, he reveals Little Red Riding Hood's true colors, turns Chicken Little over to a shrink, arrests a dragon for overacting (a &quot;dragonet&quot; -- get it?! Duuumb da-dumb dumb!), and puts Ebeneezer Scrooge in the modern-day business world (not a far stretch!). Musical? Maybe. Funny? Definitely! ~ Matthew Robinson\n\nIncludes liner notes by Steve Kolanjian &amp; Stan Freberg.\n\nPersonnel: Peter Leeds (vocals); Red Roundtree, Dick Roberts (banjo); Nariz Grande (trumpet); Buddy Cole (piano).\n\nLiner Note Author: Stan Freberg.\n\n01.
