But Clear, the band's first release since 2000's Below the Under, should up the quintet's visibility. Smacking of Tool meets Disturbed with a strong pop sensibility, Clear's dozen songs are dramatic, but not overwrought, segueing smoothly from somnolent to edgy, often within one song. From the moody yet dynamic &quot;The Other One&quot; to &quot;Wrong Replacement,&quot; which begins gently before morphing into an intense chorus, the Color Red prove themselves strong writers. Clear should help the Color Red turn platinum.\n\nThe Color Red - Clear 2002\n\nGenre - alternative rock, alternative metal, Rock\n\n1. The Other One\t3:51\n2. Cleansing            3:36\n3.
