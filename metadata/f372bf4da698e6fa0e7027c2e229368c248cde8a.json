Part of that HTML file contained a Wholesale DVD Supplier List. It occurred to me that I had seen such lists for sale on eBay for anywhere from .99 to 9.99 and I thought, &amp;#039;&amp;#039;H*ll, these lists should be FREE&amp;#039;&amp;#039; To that end, I have extracted the DVD supplier list from the UP512K.HTM file and placed it here. I am now embarking upon a research campaign in which I intend to seek out every possible wholesale DVD and CD supplier that I can find. So, if this interests you, please feel free to message me, and if you have any additions to the list, please feel free to send them to me as well, as I plan to continually expand and update the wholesale lists - so keep a check on my torrents - hopefully this will be a worthwhile project.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f372bf4da698e6fa0e7027c2e229368c248cde8a","amp;dn":"Wholesale+CD%2FDVD+Lists+-+List+%231","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f372bf4da698e6fa0e7027c2e229368c248cde8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,114,191,77,166,152,230,250,14,112,39,194,226,41,54,140,36,140,222,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
