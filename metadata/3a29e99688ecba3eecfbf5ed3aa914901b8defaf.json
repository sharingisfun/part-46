It was an eerie sight. Obelisks shaped crystals up to 37 feet (11 meter) in length and the equivalent height of six men jutted out from the damp rock walls, and there were hundreds of blade-sharp crystals. \n\n\n\nGeologist Juan Manuel GarcÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­a-Ruiz calls it &quot;the Sistine Chapel of crystals,&quot; but Superman could call it home.\nA sort of south-of-the-border Fortress of Solitude, Mexico's Cueva de los Cristales (Cave of Crystals) contains some of the world's largest known natural crystalsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½translucent beams of gypsum as long as 36 feet (11 meters).\n\n\n\n\nHow did the crystals reach such superheroic proportions?\n\n\n\nIn the new issue of the journal Geology, GarcÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­a-Ruiz reports that for millennia the crystals thrived in the cave's extremely rare and stable natural environment. Temperatures hovered consistently around a steamy 136 degrees Fahrenheit (58 degrees Celsius), and the cave was filled with mineral-rich water that drove the crystals' growth.\n\n\nModern-day mining operations exposed the natural wonder by pumping water out of the 30-by-90-foot (10-by-30-meter) cave, which was found in 2000 near the town of Delicias (Chihuahua state map). Now GarcÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­a-Ruiz is advising the mining company to preserve the caves. \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Chuck Klausmeyer\n=============================\n\n\nDirected by: Gary Lang\n======================\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    Giant Crystal Cave \nYear.................:    2008\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    00:45:48\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3)\nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    3:2  \n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    720x480 (H.263)\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    1933 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (N/A) \nFile Size:...........:    633 MB\nFPS..................:    29.970000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2008\n\n\n\n\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1492853/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1492853/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\\\\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\\\\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\\\\\&quot;nfo\\\\\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            *** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a29e99688ecba3eecfbf5ed3aa914901b8defaf","amp;dn":"Giant+Crystal+Cave-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a29e99688ecba3eecfbf5ed3aa914901b8defaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,41,233,150,136,236,186,62,236,251,245,237,58,169,20,144,27,141,239,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
