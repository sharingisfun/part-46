Encyclopedic in scope, it is the only book to focus on the characteristics that make the ferret an important research animal, with detailed information on conditions, procedures, and treatments. Offering basic information on biology, husbandry, clinical medicine, and surgery, as well as unique information on the use of ferrets in biomedical research, Biology and Diseases of the Ferret is an essential resource for investigators using ferrets in the laboratory and for companion animal and comparative medicine veterinarians.\nThe Third Edition adds ten completely new chapters, covering regulatory considerations, black-footed ferret recovery, diseases of the cardiovascular system, viral respiratory disease research, morbillivirus research, genetic engineering, hearing and auditory function, vision and neuroplasticity research, nausea and vomiting research, and lung carcinogenesis research. Additionally, the anesthesia, surgery, and biomethodology chapter has been subdivided into three and thoroughly expanded. The book also highlights the ferret genome project, along with the emerging technology of genetically engineered ferrets, which is of particular importance to the future of the ferret as an animal model in research and will allow the investigation of diseases and their genetic basis in a small, easily maintained, non-rodent species.\n\nKey Features:\n\n    Offers a revised edition of the only book available covering the use of ferrets in biomedical research\n    Includes new chapters on regulatory considerations, black-footed ferret recovery, physical examination and diagnosis, diseases of the cardiovascular system, bacterial and mycoplasmal diseases, viral respiratory disease research, morbillivirus research, genetic engineering, hearing and auditory function, vision and neuroplasticity research, nausea and vomiting research, and lung carcinogenesis research\n    Expands the existing information on anesthesia and surgery, viral disease research, and neuroscience research to provide a wealth of new information\n    Provides detailed information on conditions, procedures, and treatments relevant to this important species\n    Thoroughly revised and updated to provide a current reference that is exhaustive in scope\n    Published in association with the American College of Laboratory Animal Medicine \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55f610e59e5cca5a8afefbbff10b8aeb478733b9","amp;dn":"Biology+and+Diseases+of+the+Ferret%2C+3rd+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55f610e59e5cca5a8afefbbff10b8aeb478733b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,246,16,229,158,92,202,90,138,254,251,191,241,11,138,235,71,135,51,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
