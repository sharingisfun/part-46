Arcade Sound Ltd. released his debut EP, the summery yet bittersweet Four More Years, in mid-2010. Jamison played 2011's South by Southwest festival and toured Canada before his second EP, A Silent Planet (which was inspired by the time Jamison spent reading C.S. Lewis' Out of the Silent Planet during a seven-week stay in the Swiss Alps studying philosophy), arrived on the Waaga label in August 2010. Jamison also did remixes for artists such as Seven Saturdays and issued music with his other project, Two Bicycles. In mid-2011, Jamison recorded Teen Daze's first full-length, All of Us, Together, this time inspired in part by Utopian Visions, a book he discovered in a thrift store. The album was released the following year; later in 2012, Jamison returned with The Inner Mansions, a more personal set of songs that also featured a cover of Brian Eno's &quot;Always Returning.&quot; For 2013's Glacier, the producer opted for a more insular, ambient-inspired sound.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1c484b920cc1ea1c4806192f462d24351106f81","amp;dn":"Teen+Daze+-+Glacier+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1c484b920cc1ea1c4806192f462d24351106f81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,196,132,185,32,204,30,161,196,128,97,146,244,98,210,67,81,16,111,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
