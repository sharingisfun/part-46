As you read this book, I\nhope that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be reminded of how important freedom is to the hacking\ncommunity and that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be inclined to support the causes that Aaron\nbelieved in.\nI agreed to release this book for free in part because AaronÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s treatment by\nMIT is not unfamiliar to me. In this book, you will find the story of when\nI was an MIT graduate student, extracting security keys from the original\nMicrosoft Xbox. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also read about the crushing disappointment of\nreceiving a letter from MIT legal repudiating any association with my\nwork, effectively leaving me on my own to face Microsoft.\nThe difference was that the faculty of my lab, the AI laboratory, were\noutraged by this treatment. They openly defied MIT legal and vowed\nto publish my work as an official Ã¢â‚¬Å“AI Lab Memo,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ thereby granting me\ngreater negotiating leverage with Microsoft. Microsoft, mindful of the\npotential backlash from the court of public opinion over suing a legitimate\nacademic researcher, came to a civil understanding with me over the issue.\nIt saddens me that AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s so-called government for the people, by the\npeople, and of the people has less compassion and enlightenment toward\ntheir fellow man than a corporation. Having been a party to subsequent\nlegal bullying by other entities, I am all too familiar with how ugly and\ngut-wrenching a high-stakes lawsuit can be. Fortunately, the stakes in my\ncases were not as high, nor were my adversaries as formidable as AaronÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s,\nor I too might have succumbed to hopelessness and fear. A few years ago,\nI started rebuilding my life overseas, and I find a quantum of solace in the\nthought that my residence abroad makes it a little more difficult for me to\nbe served.\nWhile the US legal system strives for justice, the rules of the system\ncreate an asymmetric war that favors those with resources. By far one of\nthe most effective methods to force a conclusion, right or wrong, against\na small player is to simply bleed them of resources and the will to fight\nthrough pre-trial antics. Your entire life feels like it is under an electron\nmicroscope, with every tiny blemish magnified into a pitched battle of\nmotions, countermotions, discovery, subpoenas, and affidavits, and each\naction heaping tens of thousands of dollars onto your legal bill. Your\nfriends, co-workers, employers, and family are drawn into this circus of\nhumiliation as witnesses. Worse, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re counseled not to speak candidly\nto anyone, lest they be summoned as a witness against you. Isolated\nand afraid, it eventually makes more sense to roll over and settle than to\ntake the risk of losing on a technicality versus a better-funded adversary,\nregardless of the justice.\nThe US government is far and away the best-funded and fearsome enemy\nin the world, and copyright law has some unusually large, if not cruel,\npenalties associated with it. I never knew Aaron, but I feel that the magnitude\nof the bullying he was subjected to is reflected in his decision to end\nhis life.\nI echo Larry LessigÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s notion that the US legal system needs a sense of\nshame. To an outsider like me, it seems that certain prosecutors in the\nUS government are obsessed with making a name for themselves at the\nexpense of the individuals they pursue. Winning cases gains them the recognition\nand credibility needed for promotions and assignments to ever\nhigher profile cases. For them, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not about justiceÃ¢â‚¬â€itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about victory\nand self-aggrandizement.\nThis system of incentives contributes to the shameless bullying of individuals\nand small entities who have the guts to stand up and do something\ndaring. Individuals are robbed of the will and strength to fight for what\nthey feel is right, as the mere act of prosecution can be as much a punishment\nas the verdict. As a result, I fear that the era of civil disobedience\nmay be coming to a close.\nAs people, as individuals, as hackers, we need to oppose this trend and\ncontinue to do what we feel deep down in our hearts is right. While\nAaronÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story came to a tragic end, I hope that in this book you will find\nan encouraging story with a happy ending. Without the right to tinker\nand explore, we risk becoming enslaved by technology; and the more we\nexercise the right to hack, the harder it will be to take that right away.\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIf you like it\nSeed it\n////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fecf1ef1a519688e36c27b98107ece25edf30669","amp;dn":"Hacking+the+Xbox+.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fecf1ef1a519688e36c27b98107ece25edf30669","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,207,30,241,165,25,104,142,54,194,123,152,16,126,206,37,237,243,6,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
