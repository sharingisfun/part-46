Some of the novels in which he appears were written in collaboration with John Thewes, Douglas Rutherford, or Charles Hatten ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and those with Rutherford were even published under the name &quot;Paul Temple&quot;, thus making the fictional writer a &quot;real&quot; one.\n\nTemple is an amateur private detective and author of crime fiction. Together with his wife Steve, he solves the featured &quot;whodunnit&quot; crimes with subtle, humorous dialogue and rare &quot;action&quot;. Always the gentleman, his use of the phrase &quot;by Timothy&quot; was the nearest he ever got to swearing. The introductory and closing music for the majority of the long-running BBC radio series was Coronation Scot (a musical depiction of a train journey) written by Vivian Ellis.\n\nPaul Temple was &quot;born&quot; as a radio detective. In Britain, several Paul Temple radio series were broadcast from the 1930s to the 1960s. While several actors and actresses portrayed the Temples over the years, including the Send for Paul Temple Again series which starred Barry Morse and aired in 1945, probably the best known portrayal of the couple was by Peter Coke and Marjorie Westbury. Many of the serials starring Coke and Westbury have been repeated since 2003 by digital radio station BBC 7\n\n\n\nRegular Cast:\nPeter Coke and Marjorie Westbury\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Temple#British_Paul_Temple_radio_serials&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Temple#British_Paul_Temple_radio_serials&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nPaul Temple And The Alex Affair - 01 - Mrs Trevelyan \nPaul Temple And The Alex Affair - 02 - Dr Kohima \nPaul Temple And The Alex Affair - 03 - Mr Carl Lathom \nPaul Temple And The Alex Affair - 04 - Mr 'Spider' Williams \nPaul Temple And The Alex Affair - 05 - Mr Wilfred Davis \nPaul Temple And The Alex Affair - 06 - Mr Lee Brent \nPaul Temple And The Alex Affair - 07 - The Girl In Brown \nPaul Temple And The Alex Affair - 08 - Introducing Alex\n\nPaul Temple And The Geneva Mystery - 01 - Too Young To Die \nPaul Temple And The Geneva Mystery - 02 - Concerning Mrs Milbourne \nPaul Temple And The Geneva Mystery - 03 - A Note For Danny \nPaul Temple And The Geneva Mystery - 04 - A Change Of Mind \nPaul Temple And The Geneva Mystery - 05 - A Surprise For Mrs Milbourne \nPaul Temple And The Geneva Mystery - 06 - See You In London \n\nPaul Temple And The Gilbert Case - 01 - The Unlucky One \nPaul Temple And The Gilbert Case - 02 - The Third Shoe \nPaul Temple And The Gilbert Case - 03 - Peter Galino \nPaul Temple And The Gilbert Case - 04 - La Mortella \nPaul Temple And The Gilbert Case - 05 - That Good Old Intuition \nPaul Temple And The Gilbert Case - 06 - A Warning From Miss Wayne \nPaul Temple And The Gilbert Case - 07 - The Note \nPaul Temple And The Gilbert Case - 08 - The Guilty Party \n\nPaul Temple And The Jonathan Mystery - 01 - The Fergusons \nPaul Temple And The Jonathan Mystery - 02 - That Good Old Intuition \nPaul Temple And The Jonathan Mystery - 03 - The Ring \nPaul Temple And The Jonathan Mystery - 04 - The Encounter \nPaul Temple And The Jonathan Mystery - 05 - Concerning Richard Ferguson \nPaul Temple And The Jonathan Mystery - 06 - A Surprise For Mavis Russell \nPaul Temple And The Jonathan Mystery - 07 - An Invitation For Mr Elliott \nPaul Temple And The Jonathan Mystery - 08 - Jonathan \n\nPaul Temple And The Margo Mystery - 01 - The Coat \nPaul Temple And The Margo Mystery - 02 - Concerning Ted Angus \nPaul Temple And The Margo Mystery - 03 - A Change Of Mind \nPaul Temple And The Margo Mystery - 04 - Bill Fletcher's Story \nPaul Temple And The Margo Mystery - 05 - Breakwater House \nPaul Temple And The Margo Mystery - 06 - Mainly About Wyman \nPaul Temple And The Margo Mystery - 07 - A Time To Worry \nPaul Temple And The Margo Mystery - 08 - The Visitor \n\nPaul Temple And The Spencer Affair - 01 - My Heart And Harry \nPaul Temple And The Spencer Affair - 02 - Concerning Judy Milton \nPaul Temple And The Spencer Affair - 03 - Introducing Pete Roberts \nPaul Temple And The Spencer Affair - 04 - That Old Intuition \nPaul Temple And The Spencer Affair - 05 - A Surprise For Pete Roberts \nPaul Temple And The Spencer Affair - 06 - Home Again \nPaul Temple And The Spencer Affair - 07 - Dinner At The Stardust \nPaul Temple And The Spencer Affair - 08 - A Party Of Four \n\n\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration Approx : 28mn 0s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\t\t\n\n[\n\n\nI post quite a few torrents if this site is down when I post a new one I don't have time to keep trying.\nIf it's down then it's skipped.\n\nYou can follow me on Twitter so you don't miss any\n\n\nOr add the RSS feed in uTorrent (In FEEDS on the left add)\n\n\n\n.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65571de928cabfcd6cb115103a18affad51af8b8","amp;dn":"Paul+Temple+-+Audio+Drama+-+MP3++-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65571de928cabfcd6cb115103a18affad51af8b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,87,29,233,40,202,191,205,108,177,21,16,58,24,175,250,213,26,248,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
