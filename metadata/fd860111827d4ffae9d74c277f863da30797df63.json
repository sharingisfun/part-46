Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon) was a gifted amateur golfer from Savannah, GA, until traumatic experiences during World War I shattered his confidence and sent him into a spiral of alcoholism. In 1931, Adele Invergordon (Charlize Theron), a beautiful heiress who once loved Junuh, inherits a spectacular but financially ailing golf course after the suicide of her father. To attract customers, she proposed a high-stakes match between the two most famous golfers of the day, Bobby Jones (Joel Gretsch) and Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill). Local businessmen sponsoring the match insist that a local golfer be added to the card, and Junuh is drafted for the position, but it soon becomes obvious that his game is just a shadow of its former glory. When things seem hopeless, a mysterious gentleman named Bagger Vance (Will Smith) volunteers to serve as Junuh's caddy and coach, using a mixture of ancient wisdom and past-life knowledge to help Junah &quot;remember&quot; the swing he's lost. Jack Lemmon narrates the story, and J. Michael Moncrief plays Lemmon's character as a boy. ~ Mark Deming, All Movie Guide\n\nCast: Will Smith, Matt Damon, Charlize Theron, Bruce McGill, Joel Gretsch...\n\nYear: 2000\n\nDuration: 127 minutes\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nFormat: DVD 5\n\nScreen: 16:9\n\nStandard: NTSC\n\nAudio: English (Dolby Digital 5.1 ), Spanish &amp; Portuguese (Dolby 2.0)\n\nSubtitles: English, Spanish &amp; Portuguese\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd860111827d4ffae9d74c277f863da30797df63","amp;dn":"The+Legend+of+Bagger+Vance+%282000%29+%28NTSC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd860111827d4ffae9d74c277f863da30797df63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,134,1,17,130,125,79,250,233,215,76,39,127,134,61,163,7,151,223,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
