The stars of Duck Dynasty may leave A&amp;E entirely after the network suspended the patriarch of the family, Phil Robertson, for expressing his faith in a recent GQ article. Media pundits are calling Robertson's views on homosexuality &quot;hate speech,&quot; which by their definition would surely include the Holy Bible as well. \n\nThe founder of Freedom Watch, Larry Klayman, was also attacked by the mainstream media this week after he won a lawsuit against the NSA and he joins the show to break down the media's attempts to silence opposition. \n\nWell-known submersion journalist Amber Lyon also joins the broadcast to share her front-line experiences with Americans not afraid to stand up for the First Amendment.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
