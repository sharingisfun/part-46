We all know for this popular image viewer. Only difference between normal freeware copy and this one ?registered? is your name on ?About dialog?. Stupid reason for keygening, i know? Personally i couldn?t imagine my daily work on PC without IrfanView, so if u want a powerful, but easy to use image viewer give it a try. Trust me, you wont be disappointed. \nIrfanView is a very fast, small, compact and innovative FREEWARE (for non-commercial use) graphic viewer for Windows 9x/ME/NT/2000/XP/2003/Vista.\n\nIrfanView is trying to create new and/or interesting features in its own way, unlike some other graphic viewers, whose whole ?creativity? is based on feature cloning, stealing of ideas and whole dialogs from ACDSee and/or IrfanView! (for example: XnView has been stealing/cloning features and whole dialogs from IrfanView, for 7+ years).\n\nIrfanView was the first Windows graphic viewer WORLDWIDE with Multiple (animated) GIF support.\nOne of the first graphic viewers WORLDWIDE with Multipage TIF support.\nThe first graphic viewer WORLDWIDE with Multiple ICO support.\n\nRelease Name: IrfanView.v4.10.WinAll.Incl.Keygen-ENFUSiA\nSize: 1.1MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4fd10f875f3dbf96dd241e8273011dfe5a2f6d8","amp;dn":"IrfanView+v4.10+WinAll+Incl+Keygen-ENFUSiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4fd10f875f3dbf96dd241e8273011dfe5a2f6d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,253,16,248,117,243,219,249,109,210,65,232,39,48,17,223,229,162,246,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
