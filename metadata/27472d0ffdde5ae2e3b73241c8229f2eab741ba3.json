Two decades ago, he discovered folding bikes and started taking them on tour. ByrneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s choice was made out of convenience rather than political motivation, but the more cities he saw from his bicycle, the more he became hooked on this mode of transport and the sense of liberation it provided. Convinced that urban biking opens oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s eyes to the inner workings and rhythms of a cityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s geography and population, Byrne began keeping a journal of his observations and insights.\n\nAn account of what he sees and whom he meets as he pedals through metropoles from Berlin to Buenos Aires, Istanbul to San Francisco, Manila to New York, Bicycle Diaries also records ByrneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s thoughts on world music, urban planning, fashion, architecture, cultural dislocation, and much more, all conveyed with a highly personal mixture of humor, curiosity, and humility. Part travelogue, part journal, part photo album, Bicycle Diaries is an eye-opening celebration of seeing the world from the seat of a bike.\n\n==========================\n\nCREDITS:\n\n    Written and narrated by David Byrne\n    Music by David Byrne\n    Recorded and mixed by Josiah Hendler @ Blast Off Productions, NYC\n    Sound design by Josiah Hendler\n    Production Coordinator: Frank Hendler\n    Graphics by Danielle Spencer &amp; DB\n    Artist management: David Whitehead @ Maine Road\n    Sound design and recording for the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNew YorkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ chapter by Karen Michel\n\n==========================\n\n\nChapters:\n========\n01 Introduction\n02 American Cities\n03 Berlin\n04 Istanbul\n05 Buenos Aires\n06 Manila\n07 Sydney\n08 London\n09 San Francisco\n10 New York\n11 Epilogue\n\nAudio : MP3@192kbps | cbr | 44.1khz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27472d0ffdde5ae2e3b73241c8229f2eab741ba3","amp;dn":"David+Byrne+-+Bicycle+Diaries+-+mp3%40192+cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27472d0ffdde5ae2e3b73241c8229f2eab741ba3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,71,45,15,253,222,90,226,227,183,50,65,200,34,159,46,171,116,27,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
