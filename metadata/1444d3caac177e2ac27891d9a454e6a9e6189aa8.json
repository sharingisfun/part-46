Sourcing high school and college records from thrift stores all over the nation, Cali-Tex Records has put together a set of impossible-to-find tracks that begs the question: &quot;How could lightning strike twice?&quot; There's thousands of awful high school records from the '60s and '70s, making the mere existence of these two comps a minor miracle. Funk, breaks, soulful ballads, and improbably psychedelic madness mesh in gloriously unpretentious fashion. So go on, relish in the modern miracle that is &quot;Schoolhouse Funk II.&quot;\n\n===================================================================\n\nNo password, Very good quality [VBR up to 320Kbs], Ripped from original, All tagged, Included covers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1444d3caac177e2ac27891d9a454e6a9e6189aa8","amp;dn":"DJ+Shadow+-+Schoolhouse+Funk+II+%28Raw+Business%29+%28US+2005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1444d3caac177e2ac27891d9a454e6a9e6189aa8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,68,211,202,172,23,126,42,194,120,145,217,164,84,230,169,230,24,154,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
