Frey\nSt. Martin's Press | March 2010 | ISBN-10: 0312575076 | PDF | 304 pages | 15.7 mb &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Write-Damn-Thriller-Step---Step/dp/B007PM0498&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Write-Damn-Thriller-Step---Step/dp/B007PM0498&lt;/a&gt;\n\nA quick look at any fiction bestseller list reveals that thrillers make up most of the titles at the top. HOW TO WRITE A DAMN GOOD THRILLER will help the aspiring novelist or screenwriter to design, draft, write, and polish a thriller that is sure to grab readers. Frey uses examples from both books and movies and addresses the following hot topics:\n\n* Germinal ideas\n* Breathing life into great thriller characters\n* Crafting a gripping opening\n* Maintaining tension\n* Creating obstacles and conflicts\n* Writing a mean, lean thriller scene\n* Adding surprise twists\n* Building a smashing climax\n\nand many more.\n\nIn his trademark approachable and humorous style, Frey illuminates the building blocks of great thrillers and gives the reader the tools to write his or her own.\n\nThe authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fifth guide to writing Ã¢â‚¬Å“damn good fictionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ offers a useful and entertaining look at the process of writing a thriller. Some readers may be confused, at first, by his seemingly overbroad definition of a thriller (the Iliad? Miss Congeniality?), but thrillers, Frey argues, should be defined by their key elements: heroes with impossible missions, theatrically extreme villains, a series of obstacles, a rousing climax. The author leads us through the process of putting together a thriller by creating several stories and then showing us how to elaborate their plots and how to design their characters. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an interesting approach, sort of a hands-on seminar. He also refers frequently to various well-known thrillers (The Boys from Brazil, Jaws, The Day of the Jackal, etc.) and explains why they work the way they do. By adopting a practical approachÃ¢â‚¬â€showing us in specific terms how to build a character, for example, rather than simply giving us general pointersÃ¢â‚¬â€Frey makes the prospect of writing a novel feel considerably less daunting.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6858e23e2bc5dff0d14c6f4385e4dc475bb83575","amp;dn":"How+To+Write+A+Damn+Good+Thriller+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6858e23e2bc5dff0d14c6f4385e4dc475bb83575","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,88,226,62,43,197,223,240,209,76,111,67,133,228,220,71,91,184,53,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
