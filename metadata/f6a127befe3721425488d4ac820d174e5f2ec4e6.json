Ever since then, he's been touring with various folk and country acts as a backing musician for such acts as Carrie Newcomer, Bill Wilson, Kim Fox, Hal Ketchum and John Prine. After winning some recognition from Billboard Magazine and the Chris Austin Songwriting Award in 1995, Jason Wilber finally released his solo debut in 1998. Courtesy of Flat Earth Records, the album's entitled &quot;Lost in Your Hometown&quot; and takes a cue from his country influences of Tom T. Hall and Johnny Cash.\n-- Mike DaRonco, All Music Guide \n\nFeaturing the following songs:\n\n1. I Fell In Line \n2. Walking In The Church \n3. Pick Up Your Heart \n4. Lost In Your Hometown \n5.
