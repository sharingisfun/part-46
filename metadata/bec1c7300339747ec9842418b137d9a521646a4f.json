Mankind has operated within their influence for two centuries, establishing a dozen human colony worlds scattered along Shoal trade routes.\n\nDakota Merrick, while serving as a military pilot, has witnessed atrocities for which this alien race is responsible. Now piloting a civilian cargo ship, she is currently ferrying an exploration team to a star system containing a derelict star ship. From its wreckage, her passengers hope to salvage a functioning FTL drive of mysteriously non-Shoal origin. But the Shoal are not yet ready to relinquish their monopoly over a technology they acquired through ancient genocide.\n\nUnabridged.\nRead by Charlie Norfolk.\n\n------------------------------\nVisit us for this and more, book requests can also be made through the site:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.ws\n------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bec1c7300339747ec9842418b137d9a521646a4f","amp;dn":"Stealing+Light+-+Gary+Gibson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bec1c7300339747ec9842418b137d9a521646a4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,193,199,48,3,57,116,126,201,132,36,24,177,55,217,165,33,100,106,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
