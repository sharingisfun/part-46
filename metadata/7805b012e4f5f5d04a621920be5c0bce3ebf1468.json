Not so Xara3D. Unlike much modern 'bloatware' that offers more features than are ever likely to be used, and take an age to learn and understand, Xara3D has been created to perform one job, and performs that job with style, speed, and slick simplicity.\n\nXara3D is solely designed to create the highest quality 3D text and graphics, such as logos, titles, headings and buttons. It's the perfect way to add impact to your web pages, mailshots and presentations (all images are fully anti-aliased for that smooth, professional quality). Xara3D can also create awesome 3D animations in seconds - GIFs, AVIs and simple Flash movie sequences - and you can even enhance your desktop by saving any animation as a screensaver! \n \nBut you needn't take our word for it ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ check out the testimonials from existing Xara3D users and Xara3D reviews.  \n                             \n                                    &lt;a href=&quot; http://site.xara.com/products/xara3d/features/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://site.xara.com/products/xara3d/features/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCreating and Importing\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Text headings can use any TrueType font.
