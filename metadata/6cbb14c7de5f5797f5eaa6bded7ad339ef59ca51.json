Graphics, called by the author, &quot;the language of scientists and engineers&quot;, physical interpretation of subtle mathematical concepts, and a gradual transition from basic to more advanced topics are meant to be among the important contributions of this book.\n\nAfter illustrating the analysis of a function through a step-by-step addition of harmonics, the book deals with Fourier and Laplace transforms. It then covers discrete time signals and systems, the z-transform, continuous- and discrete-time filters, active and passive filters, lattice filters, and continuous- and discrete-time state space models. The author goes on to discuss the Fourier transform of sequences, the discrete Fourier transform, and the fast Fourier transform, followed by Fourier-, Laplace, and z-related transforms, including WalshÃ¢â‚¬â€œHadamard, generalized Walsh, Hilbert, discrete cosine, Hartley, Hankel, Mellin, fractional Fourier, and wavelet. He also surveys the architecture and design of digital signal processors, computer architecture, logic design of sequential circuits, and random signals. He concludes with simplifying and demystifying the vital subject of distribution theory.\n\nDrawing on much of the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own research work, this book expands the domains of existence of the most important transforms and thus opens the door to a new world of applications using novel, powerful mathematical tools.\n\nAbout the Author :-\n\nMichael Corinthios, Ph.D., Fellow IEEE, FIET is a professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Ãƒâ€°cole Polytechnique de MontrÃƒÂ©al, Quebec, Canada.\n\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cbb14c7de5f5797f5eaa6bded7ad339ef59ca51","amp;dn":"Signals%2C+Systems%2C+Transforms%2C+and+Digital+Signal+Processing+with","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cbb14c7de5f5797f5eaa6bded7ad339ef59ca51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,187,20,199,222,95,87,151,245,234,166,189,237,122,211,57,239,89,202,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
