The series, starting as a series of one-shots, was created by writer and sometime penciller Tim Seeley. The focus of the series is on a horror victim, Cassie, who strikes back at the monsters, known as &quot;slashers&quot;, with Vlad, a freakish man who frequently wears a gas mask.\n\n\n\nI&amp;#039;ve taken the liberty of numbering the one-shots by publication date.\n\nI apologize in advance for my crappy upload speed.\n\nAs always, thanks to the original scanners :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42133f90cfdb0e85d64a2f61d6c53d870dd9c2b9","amp;dn":"Hack%2FSlash","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42133f90cfdb0e85d64a2f61d6c53d870dd9c2b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,19,63,144,207,219,14,133,214,74,47,97,214,197,61,135,13,217,194,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
