He was intelligent but socially isolated; his talents won him jobs with toy makers and rock bands but did little to endear him to authority figures and classmates, who were put off by his inclination to blurt out non sequiturs and avoid eye contact.\n\nBy the time he was diagnosed at age forty, John had already developed a myriad of coping strategies that helped him achieve a seemingly normal, even highly successful, life. In Be Different, Robison shares a new batch of endearing stories\nabout his childhood, adolescence, and young adult years, giving the reader a rare window into the Aspergian mind.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bba5dbaeae8ef0028a156109f953cf3915c02e92","amp;dn":"Be+Different%3A+Adventures+of+a+Free-Range+Aspergian+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bba5dbaeae8ef0028a156109f953cf3915c02e92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,165,219,174,174,142,240,2,138,21,97,9,249,83,207,57,21,192,46,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
