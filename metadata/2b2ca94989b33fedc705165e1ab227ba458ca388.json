Now gamers can bring the MAGIC experience off the card table and onto their PlayStations. For those unfamiliar with the series, you play as a magician who summons monsters, spells, and effects to combat other players or magicians. If you are victorious, you are awarded you opponent's cards, which you can then use to summon more monsters, spells, and effects. The gameplay is real-time strategy, so gamers will have to have quick hands and quicker wits to defeat the computer. All of the cards from the original game are represented, so longtime fans of the series should look forward to meeting some old friends in real time with MAGIC: The Gathering.\n\n\nTested and working on all CFW's 5.00 m33 and above using the 500 popsloader pack set on 3.72 POPS...KloWn\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nJade Cocoon\nFear Effect\nDestrega","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b2ca94989b33fedc705165e1ab227ba458ca388","amp;dn":"%28PSX-PSP%29+Magic%3AThe+Gathering+converted+properly+%28Kingdom-games+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b2ca94989b33fedc705165e1ab227ba458ca388","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,44,169,73,137,179,63,237,199,5,22,94,26,178,39,186,69,140,163,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
