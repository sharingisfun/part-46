As a consequence, the album was savaged by music critics, who charged that the band had sacrificed their distinctive style.\n\nHowever, the album's accessibility to mainstream pop and rock audiences also meant that it received more radio airplay and spawned bigger chart hits (&quot;Sun Comes Up, It's Tuesday Morning&quot; and &quot;Rock and Bird&quot;, which featured Bruce Hornsby on the piano on the single version) than The Trinity Session had. A number of critics have also noted that while the album is undeniably a disappointment when compared to its predecessor, when taken on its own merits it is a better album than its initial reception would suggest.\n\nReleased\tFebruary 1990\nGenre\tAlternative rock\nLength\t44:32\nLabel\tRCA\n\nAll songs by Michael Timmins, except where noted.\n&quot;Sun Comes Up, It's Tuesday Morning&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n&quot;Cause Cheap is How I Feel&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:13\n&quot;Thirty Summers&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:15\n&quot;Mariner's Song&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:20\n&quot;Powderfinger&quot; (Neil Young) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:46\n&quot;Rock and Bird&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:30\n&quot;Witches&quot; (Michael Timmins, Margo Timmins) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:44\n&quot;Where Are You Tonight?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:07\n&quot;Escape is So Simple&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:15\n&quot;You Will Be Loved Again&quot; (Mary Margaret O'Hara) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:26\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42dc0698a7985e0b3f9605fdaf228e15e28a6bca","amp;dn":"Cowboy+Junkies...The+Caution+Horses%281990%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42dc0698a7985e0b3f9605fdaf228e15e28a6bca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,220,6,152,167,152,94,11,63,150,5,253,175,34,142,21,226,138,107,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
