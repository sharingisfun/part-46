The land-owners (left without workers to till the land) volunteer to take their places in the &quot;rest home&quot;; when the priest refuses, he is subjugated and finally becomes the only inmate of the asylum.  &quot;Some day&quot;, he muses, anticipating Laing, &quot;the madness of our day will be the reason of tomorrow.&quot; The film's radical intention is clear and the decor, color, and mise en scene extravagantly beautiful, but the audacious parable ultimately becomes labored.
