He thought long and hard     |\n|   of what to do. He realized he needed some form of entertainment. He, in    |\n|   secret, created Mike Patton, Trevor Dunn, Trey Sprunance, Jed Watts,       |\n|   Theo Lengyl, and Martin Fosnaugh. God made these folks practice for        |\n|   millions of years, until he thought they should make some demos. They      |\n|   first made The Raging Wrath Of The Easter Bunny, and while God was         |\n|   pleased with this creation, he thought that Jed and Martin were not        |\n|   right for Mr. Bungle. So, he created Scott Fritz and Hans Wagner to play   |\n|   on their next demo Bowel Of Chiley. He was very pleased with this          |\n|   release also, but though that Scott was not right for Mr. Bungle either.   |\n|   So Mr. Bungle made another demo for God and right then he knew. He         |\n|   needed Clinton KcKinnon and Danny Hefetz and then his band would be        |\n|   perfect. They recorded their last demo OU818 and god knew it was time.     |\n|   He quickly made Warner Brothers Records sign Mr. Bungle and they made      |\n|   their self titled CD. He wanted more and four years more he got it in      |\n|   the form of Disco Volante, the band at their most experimental and         |\n|   weird. The members of Mr. Bungle fired Theo before they started making     |\n|   their next album and this angered God as he knew that Theo had always      |\n|   added something great to their sound. Regardless of this, God still        |\n|   craved more of Mr. Bungle!! He had to wait patiently for four more years   |\n|   until finally they released this album, California.                        |\n|                                                                              |\n|   When God finally obtained this album, he tore off the packaging with       |\n|   glee. He didn't know what to expect. Would it be another album in the      |\n|   vein of their self titled days, a ska-circus-metal-weird-freak-out         |\n|   album? Would it be as experimental and crazy as Disco Volante? Would it    |\n|   be more experimental than Disco Volante?? Or would they go all the way     |\n|   back to their grindcore/death metal days? God couldn't think about it      |\n|   anymore and popped this CD into his CD player.                             |\n|                                                                              |\n|   The sounds of seagulls are what came from his speakers, quickly followed   |\n|   by the relaxing sounds of violins, steel guitars and other instruments     |\n|   he didn't exactly know that names of. (Yeah I know he's God...) This was   |\n|   not the Mr. Bungle he knew. He didn't know what to think. Maybe it would   |\n|   turn into the Bungle he knew. This was some sort of introduction, that's   |\n|   it! Yes! Just to trick you into thinking this album was going to be        |\n|   slow. Ha! Fat chance!! It begin to fade out. Good. That song was           |\n|   terrible, but now is fast. It's heavy. But not Bungle heavy. He turned     |\n|   off the cd as soon as he heard Mike singing. Too calm. This is not         |\n|   right.                                                                     |\n|                                                                              |\n|   He thought he should go to bed. He did, and the next day he came to the    |\n|   CD with a different point of view. He turned the CD on again. Bracing      |\n|   himself for what was about to come, he just listened. There were those     |\n|   damn seagulls again. It didn't seem to bother him as much this time. The   |\n|   seconds those relaxing instruments came on he knew. Yes, this was the      |\n|   same Bungle. He loved it. He listened to the whole thing. Through the      |\n|   jazzy None Of Them Knew They Were Robots. Through the haunting             |\n|   RetroVertigo. Through the spastic Air Conditioned Nightmare. Through       |\n|   everything. He listened to it again and again and again. He flat out       |\n|   loved it.                                                                  |\n|                                                                              |\n|   You see, Mr. Bungle go everywhere. They are most definitely not afraid     |\n|   to experiment with different instruments, and give many layers to their    |\n|   songs. Goodbye Sober Day has been rumored to have used 40 separate         |\n|   tracks to make the final song. Mr. Bungle journey from genre to genre      |\n|   within one song, within seconds you go from listening to tribal chanting   |\n|   to metal. It all happens so smooth, and never comes off as forced. What    |\n|   is on this album cannot be put into one single genre, and I don't think    |\n|   anyone will ever be able sum up Mr. Bungle with a single word, and this    |\n|   album portrays them at what many see as their best.                        |\n|                                                                              |\n|   Every song on hear is completely beautiful in their own way, and all do    |\n|   take time to grow on you. Every song has enormous replay value, as there   |\n|   are many new things to discover upon each listen. I still can listen to    |\n|   a song, which I have practically memorized and be amazed by finding a      |\n|   new instrument hiding deep within the mix. This music is fun and           |\n|   unpredictable.                                                             |\n|                                                                              |\n|   It is their last album, and they have officially disbanded even though     |\n|   they do continue to all make music in other projects, they will never be   |\n|   able to touch the music they made when they all came together, as when     |\n|   their minds combine and they play their instruments together, there is     |\n|   nothing that they can do to beat the emotion, talent, and sheer            |\n|   creativity that they made. I believe that the best word that you can use   |\n|   to sum up Mr. Bungle and this album is remarkable.
