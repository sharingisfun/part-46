It was the first of their original albums to feature Danny Kirwan and the last with Peter Green. Jeremy Spencer did not feature on the album apart from \\\\\\&quot;a couple of piano things\\\\\\&quot; (according to Mick Fleetwood in Q magazine in 1990). The record, appearing after the group\\\\\\'s sudden success in the pop charts, offered a broader stylistic range than the classic blues of the group\\\\\\'s first two albums.\n\nTracklist:\n1 Coming Your Way (3:47)\n2 Closing My Eyes (4:50)\n3 Show-Biz Blues (3:50)\n4 My Dream (3:30)\n5 Underway (2:51)\n6 Oh Well (8:56)\n7 Althrough The Sun Is Shining (2:31)\n8 Rattlesnake Shake (3:32)\n9 Searching For Madge (6:56)\n10 Fighting For Madge (2:45)\n11 When You Say (4:22)\n12 Like Crying (2:21)\n13 Before The Beginning (3:28 )\n\n\n\nFleetwood Mac\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tPeter Green ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals, guitar, harmonica, six string bass, violoncello on \\\\\\&quot;Oh Well, Pt. 2\\\\\\&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tDanny Kirwan ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals, guitar\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tJohn McVie ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass guitar\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tMick Fleetwood ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums, percussion\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tJeremy Spencer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ piano on \\\\\\&quot;Oh Well\\\\\\&quot; {Pt 2}\nAdditional Personnel\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tChristine Perfect ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ piano (uncredited) \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tBig Walter Horton ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ harmonica (uncredited)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tSandra Elsdon ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ recorders on \\\\\\&quot;Oh Well (Pt 2)\\\\\\&quot; (uncredited) \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e3353ee71f42946e1849f0d1a2cd619393c0958","amp;dn":"Fleetwood+Mac+Then+Play+On%28rock%29%28flac%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e3353ee71f42946e1849f0d1a2cd619393c0958","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,51,83,238,113,244,41,70,225,132,159,13,26,44,214,25,57,60,9,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
