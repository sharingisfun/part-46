The poetry sampler showcases six of forty-two verses that give readers an idea about how I view my life as a disabled and gay man.  TERWILLIGER'S TOMBSTONE TERROR is a nostalgic novella that deals with how a boy and his newfound friend thwart a pesky school bully.\n\n\nThe remaining two .PDF files are a call to action to share the files if what is read is liked and a listing of where all my other works can be purchased.\n\n\nI appreciate all downloads, likes and purchases.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bd861083bf09d424f7abadab7ce38a084332982","amp;dn":"I+Am+Destiny%27s+Child+and+Other+Poems+-+Terwilliger%27s+Tombstone+T","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bd861083bf09d424f7abadab7ce38a084332982","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,216,97,8,59,240,157,66,79,122,186,218,183,206,56,160,132,51,41,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
