The winner received US$150,000 and bragging rights as &quot;The Contender Champion&quot;.\n\nThe program was hosted by Vice President of World Muay Thai Council and former World Champion Stephen Fox (who also serves as the show's main trainer) and Jaymee Ong.[2][3]\n\nThe second season has been announced on its official website. Production will begin in late September 2009 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, with 16 fighters (14 currently revealed) vying for the title and a bigger cash prize, which the producers say as &quot;the highest prize money ever to be paid out in the sport of Muay Thai.&quot;[4]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df88cd8a92b1914398b74b37a8dcd069ad809d96","amp;dn":"The+Contender+Asia+Season+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df88cd8a92b1914398b74b37a8dcd069ad809d96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,136,205,138,146,177,145,67,152,183,75,55,168,220,208,105,173,128,157,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
