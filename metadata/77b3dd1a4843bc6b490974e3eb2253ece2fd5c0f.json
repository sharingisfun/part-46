Houses mysteriously transform into log cabins and the street now ends in what looks like a child's hand-drawn western landscape. Masterminding this sudden onslaught is the evil creature Tak, who has taken over the body of an autistic boy whose parents were killed in a drive-by shooting several months earlier.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77b3dd1a4843bc6b490974e3eb2253ece2fd5c0f","amp;dn":"Regulators%2C+The+-+Stephen+King-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77b3dd1a4843bc6b490974e3eb2253ece2fd5c0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,179,221,26,72,67,188,107,73,9,116,227,235,34,83,236,226,253,92,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
