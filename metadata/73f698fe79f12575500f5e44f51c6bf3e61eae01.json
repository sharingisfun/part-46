It&amp;#039;s always instructive to glimpse how one culture&amp;#039;s music is perceived by another, whether through a funhouse mirror, from under a microscope, or even face-to-face. The performances gathered here range from misguided (Albert Pla&amp;#039;s bizarre Spanish language take on Lou Reed&amp;#039;s &quot;Take A Walk On The Wild Side&quot;) to hilarious (Fatal Mambo&amp;#039;s salsa interpretation of Mungo Jerry&amp;#039;s &quot;In The Summertime&quot;) to a delightful breath of fresh air (Malian girl group Les Go&amp;#039;s version of Hall &amp; Oates&amp;#039; &quot;I CanÃ‚Â¹t Go For That&quot;). Nenes&amp;#039; earnest Japanese-language rendition of Bob Marley&amp;#039;s &quot;No Woman No Cry&quot; is laced with plangent plucked samisens and is somehow extremely touching. Other attempts are less effective, but at least none of them come across as cynical and all are worth a listen.\n\n\nTracklist:\n1.
