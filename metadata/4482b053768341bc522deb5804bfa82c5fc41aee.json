The movie\ncomes from 25fps source content however the French subs were labelled\nfrom ntsc content and worked well - so who knows which subs out there\nmay yet match equally. \n\nTitus is about insane cruelty that man becomes capable of when his psyche\ndescends into the condition of &quot;demonic witch&quot; as a result of a cycle of \nviolence that seems to have no end due to this insane condition which has\nhistorically fed upon itself to destroy human stocks ino something else\non most counts certainly.\n\nIf you are one who enjoys horror movies I do hope you will see a Doctor\nto put you out of your misery as there is no sanity involved in any such\nexercise amongst those that remain capable of empathy and wish to remain\nas such. A briliant University Professor named Dr. Don Carmichael Phd once\nsaid in our class lecture: &quot;What is man without empathy - but a beast!&quot; \nAmen to that!\n\nSo this isn't exactly a horror movie as we want those banned\nfor reasons that are based on humanistic idealism and societal wellness.\n\nIt is instead close enough to the genre as we would ever want to\nconsider putting on for discussion as it does tell something of what\nis the baser nature of man that comes to form in adverse circumstances \nthat have yet to see an end to on this earth.\n\nGraphic scenes of violence and cruelty - watch with due care and much \ncaution along with lotsa brandy to dull the senses. Not for gals with a hug\nthat remains real yet and which they would well want to preserve - fer sure!\n\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\nmoviesbyrizzo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4482b053768341bc522deb5804bfa82c5fc41aee","amp;dn":"Titus+%281999%29+2.8GB+720p+DivX+HD+%28moviesbyrizzo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4482b053768341bc522deb5804bfa82c5fc41aee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,130,176,83,118,131,65,188,82,45,235,88,4,191,168,44,95,196,26,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
