Lots of authentic footage of Pan Am's 747s and 737s. Also surprisingly detailed about how the terrorists cells worked and how well they were organised in many countries, among them Germany and Sweden. Western laws had not yet permitted the police to arrest people suspected of planning an act of terrorism, before any such act had been performed. The warnings even revealed that the bomb would be hidden in a radio cassette player. As a sinister coincidence, the brand would be the Toshiba &quot;Bomb-Beat&quot;.\n\nThe bombing was said to be an act of revenge after the U.S. Navy shot down a civilian Airbus 'by accident' over the Persian Gulf, killing all 290 on board, in July 1984. This atrocity received much less attention in Western media. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Am_Flight_103&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Am_Flight_103&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_Air_Flight_655&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_Air_Flight_655&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOnce the world's most prestigious airline, Pan Am was almost in free fall at this point in time. Its dynamic president, Juan Trippe, left the airline in 1968 without grooming an heir, to face a stagnation in air travel combined with fierce competition. Top management was frequently changed, and losses accumulated to over 1 billion dollars. The Lockerbie disaster was the last nail in the coffin before the airline ceased operations in 1991.\n\nThis interesting film has never been released on DVD, but I managed to obtain a very good transfer from the pristine VHS I bought from the U.S. in 2004, in a CLEAN 6-head VHS player.\n\nVery good VHSrip 688x432, original fullscreen, good simulated stereo sound.\n\nMediaInfo analysis:\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 699 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 26mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 136 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nMuxing mode                      : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 26mn\nBit rate                         : 999 Kbps\nWidth                            : 688 pixels\nHeight                           : 432 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.593\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.134\nStream size                      : 615 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 26mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 78.8 MiB (11%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 504 ms\nWriting library                  : LAME3.97\n\nSource: VHS NTSC (note that PAL/NTSC will give no problems for avi files)\n\nIf you are not happy with the aspect ratio, adjust it to 4:3 in any other program than Windows Media Player.
