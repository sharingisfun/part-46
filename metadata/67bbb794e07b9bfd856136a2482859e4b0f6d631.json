Players not previously familiar with the realm of Gurk will simply stare in slack-jawed wonder at the beautifully pixelated graphics, all the while being serenaded by the lush and authentic MIDI soundtrack. \n\nOnly the viscerally-compressed sound FX and challenging new combat tactics will snap them back to their senses. This game radiates a pure and unabashed joy of old-school RPGing; your $1 couldn't possibly go any further now, or back in 1986 when these kinds of games were actually commercially viable. Enjoy!\n\nWhat's in this version:\n* Compatibility fix for Galaxy S4\n* Fixed a rare bug in Umberton (the underground city)\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.larvalabs.gurk2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.larvalabs.gurk2&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67bbb794e07b9bfd856136a2482859e4b0f6d631","amp;dn":"Gurk+II%2C+the+8-bit+RPG+v1.10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67bbb794e07b9bfd856136a2482859e4b0f6d631","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,187,183,148,224,123,155,253,133,97,54,162,72,40,89,228,176,246,214,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
