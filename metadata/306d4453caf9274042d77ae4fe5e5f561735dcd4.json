From initially just being able to run a few public domain demos, it's current state enables many games to boot and actually go in game, such as the 'famous' Final Fantasy X or Devil May Cry 3.\n\n\nScreen Shot: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pcsx2.net/screenshots.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pcsx2.net/screenshots.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nDownload Direct Link UltraFast:\n\nEmulator.rar.html\n\n\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Have Fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ready to use, BIOS,PLUNGIS also Included!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
