Individual chapters cover each imaging modality - radiography, CT, MRI, nuclear medicine and ultrasound - reviewing the physics of the signal and its interaction with tissue, the image formation or reconstruction process, a discussion of image quality and equipment, clinical applications and biological effects and safety issues. Subsequent chapters review image analysis and visualization for diagnosis, treatment and surgery. \n\nNew to this edition: \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Appendix of questions and answers \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ New chapter on 3D image visualization \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Advanced mathematical formula in separate text boxes \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Ancillary website containing 3D animations: www.cambridge.org/suetens \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Full color illustrations throughout Engineers, clinicians, mathematicians and physicists will find this an invaluable aid in understanding the physical principles of imaging and their clinical applications.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eeac5637ca93e7675447eea2b68bac5ccd410764","amp;dn":"Fundamentals+of+Medical+Imaging+2nd+Edition+%282009%29+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eeac5637ca93e7675447eea2b68bac5ccd410764","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,172,86,55,202,147,231,103,84,71,238,162,182,139,172,92,205,65,7,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
