Potentially an endangered language, it has recently, for the first time ever, received recognition and support by the State (e.g. BBC Alba on SKY-channel 168 in the UK) instead of repression and ethnic cleansing. This language gives you access to the vibrant Celtic music scene that has exploded in recent years.\n     \nThis folder contains videos of the twice-weekly episodes, each of approximately 25 minutes long. The BBC regularly re-broadcast the entire series (of about 72 episodes). I will Upload the other Episodes when available. Here you will find: SERIES 3 - Episodes 1 to 18 (The 'missing' episode 2 of this Third Series seems to be an error by the BBC in numbering their broadcasts this year: it went from episode 1 straight to episode 3 ....!? ).\n\n     \nSOME LINKS:-\n                  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/colinandcumberland/channel/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/colinandcumberland/channel/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n                  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.ambaile.org.uk/en/help/learn_gaelic.jsp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.ambaile.org.uk/en/help/learn_gaelic.jsp&lt;/a&gt;\n \n\nMY RECOMMENDED BOOKS FOR LEARNERS:-\n\n         &quot;GrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â mar na GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â idhlig&quot; by Michel Byrne (English Version), Publisher: StÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â²rlann-Acair (2002),  can be found on the website of the Gaelic Books Council, www.gaelicbooks.org/  (Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£8.00 GBP) [Excellent!];\n\n         Colin Mark, &quot;Gaelic Verbs Systemised and Simplified&quot;, Publishers: Steve Savage 2006 (Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£14.99 GBP), [Detailed but Excellent!].\n\n\nFEAR A' BHATA  (The Boatman) - Video with lyrics translated in Gaelic and English:-\n\n                  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.bouncyhavana.com/gaelic.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.bouncyhavana.com/gaelic.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca163156a68c19479e22078643a2284eb33faedc","amp;dn":"Speaking+Our+Language+SERIES+3+Episodes+1+to+18","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca163156a68c19479e22078643a2284eb33faedc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,22,49,86,166,140,25,71,158,34,7,134,67,162,40,78,179,63,174,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
