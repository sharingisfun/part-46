Epic Catfish soloing wails with the fat sound sound that makes me smile everytime.  Guitar is prominent in the mix (as is some supercheezy early80s synth soloing).  The levels on the source CDR were extremely low so I applied a +6 dB gain to the entire show prior to tracking, making sure there was no peaking/clipping after this relatively drastic increase in volume, bringing the recording levels in line with the aud encore splice as well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:464bed21848eec20042ed48a9e9672fa32c608cf","amp;dn":"Jerry+Garcia+Band+-+1980-02-12+-+Early+Show+-+GW+Univ+in+Washing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"464bed21848eec20042ed48a9e9672fa32c608cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,75,237,33,132,142,236,32,4,46,212,138,158,150,114,250,50,198,8,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
