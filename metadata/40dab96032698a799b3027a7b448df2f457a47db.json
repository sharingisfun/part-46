What at first glance appears to be a 2-D sidescroller ripped straight from the pages of the Paper Mario universe soon turns into a 3-D action-adventure that defies all video game logic. Fusing 2-D and 3-D perspectives, not to mention RPG and platformer elements, the game slips back and forth between dimensions. The action sprawls across eight worlds filled with traps, puzzles, bizarre mysteries and items that often draw themselves out of thin air. Oh, and just because Mario's in the title doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t mean he's the only star -- players also get to play as Peach and Bowser.\n\nESRB Rating: E for Comic Mischief, Mild Cartoon Violence\nGenre: Action\nAlso Available On: GameCube\nRelease Date: September 14, 2007 (UK)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40dab96032698a799b3027a7b448df2f457a47db","amp;dn":"Wii.Super.Paper.Mario.DVD5.PAL.%5BWiiScrubbed%5D.%5BBrickblocked%5D.PBoy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40dab96032698a799b3027a7b448df2f457a47db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,218,185,96,50,105,138,121,155,48,39,167,180,72,223,47,69,122,71,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
