It is in 2 cds Mp3 format ready to be used right away.\n \nThis is a 2 cd set special edition.\n\nReview from the Dallas news\n Mr. Wright does right by &quot;I'm a Man&quot; (the advantage of method acting), and BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© slips into &quot;At Last&quot; and &quot;I'd Rather Go Blind&quot; with slinky grace. Mos Def also makes a decent Chuck Berry, although it's nearly impossible to mess up &quot;No Particular Place to Go.&quot; Even Nas, sampling Mr. Waters heavily for his educational &quot;Bridging the Gap,&quot; raps with all due respect. But with the music of Chess artists readily available, this soundtrack can't help but feel like a marketable simulation of the real thing.\n\nCD Cover http://i460.photobucket.com/albums/qq323/mccarty79/cadillac-records-music-from-the-mot.jpg\n\nTrack list \nDISC1\n1.
