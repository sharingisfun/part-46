As Nobel laureate James Buchanan has observed, Jasay subjects the state to a &quot;solid, foundational analysis, grounded in an understanding of economic theory, informed by political philosophy and a deep sense of history.&quot; The results include a &quot;devastating critique of the absurdities of modern welfare economics.&quot; Jasay traces the logical and historical progression of the state from a modest-sized protector of life and property through its development into what he believes to be an &quot;agile seducer of democratic majorities, to the welfare-dispensing drudge that it is today.&quot; Can, Jasay wonders, this seemingly inexorable expansion of the state be stopped? Or, &quot;Is the rational next step [for the state] a totalitarian enhancement of its power?&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87c7aecb3a485809376626b9181a38f31c8cd5e7","amp;dn":"The+State%2C+by+Anthony+De+Jasay+%28mobi%2C+epub%2C+rtf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87c7aecb3a485809376626b9181a38f31c8cd5e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,199,174,203,58,72,88,9,55,102,38,185,24,26,56,243,28,140,213,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
