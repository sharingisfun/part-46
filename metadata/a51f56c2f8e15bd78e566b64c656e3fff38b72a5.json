The main function of RTKF is to allow the removal of unnecessary keys from the Windows Registry. Many programs leave keys in the Registry, even after programs removal using an uninstallation facility provided with the programs themselves. RTKF allows you to decide whether to delete or leave the keys found.\r\n\r\nAn additional effect (it may be the main aim for some users) of removal of these keys is the &quot;revival&quot; of some programs trial versions after the initial trial period has expired.\r\n\r\nThe program RTKF is not a crack but is an addition to other serious Registry cleaning software. No breach of software license agreement of the programms in use which remains are found by TrashReg takes place: nothing is patched into EXE files and their action is not traced by special spies. I do not distribute any registration keys, and moreover one may not know anything about trial versions of any programs, which for their needs could write something hiddenly. So as the RTKF user you simply clean some trash from your computer Registry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a51f56c2f8e15bd78e566b64c656e3fff38b72a5","amp;dn":"Registry+Trash+Keys+Finder+v3.9.3.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a51f56c2f8e15bd78e566b64c656e3fff38b72a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,31,86,194,248,225,91,215,142,86,107,100,198,86,227,255,243,139,114,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
