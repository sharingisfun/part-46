Speedwagon\nRidin' The Storm Out\n[320k MP3]\n\nRidin' the Storm Out is the third album by REO Speedwagon, released in 1973. It was the first album to feature Mike Murphy on vocals. The sessions started out with Kevin Cronin, but he left the band before the album was finished, due to creative differences. The title track would later become a hit for the band on their live album, after Cronin had returned to the band. \n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01.&quot;Ridin' the Storm Out&quot; (Richrath) - 4:12\n02.&quot;Whiskey Night&quot; (Richrath) - 4:42\n03.&quot;Oh Woman&quot; (Richrath) - 2:46\n04.&quot;Find My Fortune&quot; (Richrath) - 2:53\n05.&quot;Open Up&quot; (Stephen Stills) - 3:31\n06.&quot;Movin'&quot; (Cronin) - 3:20\n07.&quot;Son of a Poor Man&quot; (Richrath) - 3:44\n08.&quot;Start a New Life&quot; (Richrath) - 4:48\n09.&quot;It's Everywhere&quot; (Cronin) - 3:26\n10.&quot;Without Expression (Don't Be The Man)&quot; (Reid) - 3:51\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonnel\n\nMike Murphy - Vocals\nGary Richrath - Guitar\nGregg Philbin - Bass\nNeal Doughty - Keyboards\nAlan Gratzer - Drums","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e0343cc347c0bb07ddfc1f5bbfd3bec4347cf05","amp;dn":"REO+Speedwagon+-+%5C%27Ridin%5C%27+The+Storm+Out%5C%27+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e0343cc347c0bb07ddfc1f5bbfd3bec4347cf05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,3,67,204,52,124,11,176,125,223,193,245,187,253,59,236,67,71,207,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
