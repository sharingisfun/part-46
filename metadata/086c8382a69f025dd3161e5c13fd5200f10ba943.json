Pity event organisers couldn't have got their sh*t together so fast. The whole Garth Brooks saga was genuinely like an episode of Father Ted meets Arrested Development. We may now as a nation never be able to hear the name Garth Brooks without shuddering. So where did it all go wrong? (Besides everywhere). Why were 400,000 fans let down and why has as much as Ã¢â€šÂ¬50 million been lost to the economy. This documentary will attempt to give you some answers by interviewing some of the people involved including residents from the Croke Park area, Aiken Promotions and Dublin City Council. No word from the man himself but not sure he'll ever come back to our shores now after all this. See? This is why we can't have nice things.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 22-Jul-2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:086c8382a69f025dd3161e5c13fd5200f10ba943","amp;dn":"Garth.Brooks.What.Went.Wrong.PDTV.XviD.AC3-spinzes.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"086c8382a69f025dd3161e5c13fd5200f10ba943","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,108,131,130,166,159,2,93,211,22,30,92,19,253,82,0,241,11,169,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
