Covering Ground explores hundreds of wonderful possibilities. Flowering plants, herbs, mosses, ground-hugging shrubs, and heathers, planted singly or in creative combinations, can add interest, elegance, and drama to otherwise dull and ordinary areas. \n\nAnd hardscape options, such as bluestone, crushed gravel, brick, or shredded bark mulch, can create pathways and define borders. You'll be inspired by these low-maintenance, creative ideas, and Barbara Ellis includes all of the information you need to successfully select, plant, and care for the ground covers that you choose.\n\nGenre: Non Fiction / Gardening","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5126df429f7e33df43bd155b42a05852f0e8c5a3","amp;dn":"Covering+Ground+by+Barbara+W.+Ellis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5126df429f7e33df43bd155b42a05852f0e8c5a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,38,223,66,159,126,51,223,67,189,21,91,66,160,88,82,240,232,197,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
