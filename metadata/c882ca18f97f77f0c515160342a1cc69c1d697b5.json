The film was based on Tod Robbins' 1923 short fiction story &quot;Spurs&quot;. Director Browning took the exceptional step of casting real people with deformities as the eponymous sideshow &quot;freaks&quot;, rather than using costumes and makeup.\n\nBrowning had been a member of a traveling circus in his early years, and much of the film was drawn from his personal experiences. In the film, the physically deformed &quot;freaks&quot; are inherently trusting and honorable people, while the real monsters are two of the &quot;normal&quot; members of the circus who conspire to murder one of the performers to obtain his large inheritance.\n\nCAST:-\nWallace Ford as Phroso\nLeila Hyams as Venus\nOlga Baclanova as Cleopatra\nRoscoe Ates as Roscoe\nHenry Victor as Hercules\nHarry Earles as Hans\nDaisy Earles as Frieda\nRose Dione as Madame Tetrallini\nDaisy Hilton as Siamese twin\nViolet Hilton as Siamese twin\nSchlitzie as himself\nJosephine Joseph as Half Woman-Half Man\nJohnny Eck as Half Boy\nFrances O'Connor as Armless girl\nPeter Robinson as Human skeleton\nOlga Roderick as Bearded lady\nKoo Koo as herself\nPrince Randian as The Living Torso\n\nWritten Produced Directed by \tTod Browning\n\nThe central story is of conniving trapeze artist Cleopatra, who seduces and marries sideshow midget Hans after learning of his large inheritance. At their wedding reception, the other &quot;freaks&quot; announce that they accept Cleopatra in spite of her being a &quot;normal&quot; outsider; they hold an initiation ceremony in which they pass a massive goblet of wine around the table while chanting, &quot;We accept her! We accept her! One of us! One of us! Gooble-gobble, gooble-gobble!&quot; The ceremony frightens the drunken Cleopatra, who accidentally reveals that she has been having an affair with Hercules, the strong man. She mocks the freaks, tosses the wine in their faces, and drives them away. Despite being humiliated, Hans remains with Cleopatra.\n\nHans soon becomes ill. Cleopatra had poisoned his wedding wine, and she continues to slip poison into his medicine, planning to inherit his money and run away with Hercules. \n\nAnother circus performer, Venus, overhears the conspirator couple discussing the murder plot and tells Hans and the other freaks. In the film's climax, the freaks attack the evil pair during a storm, wielding guns, knives, and other sharp-edged weapons. Hercules is not seen again (although the film's original ending had the freaks castrating him; the audience sees him later singing in falsetto). As for Cleopatra, she has become a grotesque, squawking &quot;human duck.&quot; The flesh of her hands has been melted and deformed to look like duck feet and her lower half has been permanently tarred and feathered.\n\nIn an ending MGM threw in later for a &quot;happier ending&quot;, Hans is living a millionaire's life in a huge house. Venus and her clown boyfriend Phroso visit, bringing Frieda, to whom Hans had been engaged before Cleopatra swooped in. Frieda comforts Hans when he starts to cry, assuring him that she knew he hadn't wanted the revenge to get that severe.\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES:-\nSpliced throughout the main narrative are a variety of &quot;slice of life&quot; segments detailing the lives of the sideshow performers.\nThe bearded woman, who loves the human skeleton, gives birth to their daughter. The news is spread among the freak friends by The Stork Woman (Elizabeth Green).\nViolet, a conjoined twin whose sister Daisy is married to one of the circus clowns, becomes engaged to the circus' owner. The sisters appear able to experience each other's physical sensations: Daisy appears to react with romantic arousal when Violet's fiance' kisses her, and a closed-eyed Violet knows when Daisy's shoulder has been touched. The sisters were played by real-life conjoined twins Daisy and Violet Hilton.\nIn the middle of a conversation, The Human Torso (Prince Randian) lights his own cigarette, using only his mouth. In the original scene, he also rolls the cigarette.\n\nPRODUCTION NOTES:-\nMGM had purchased the rights to Robbins' short story, Spurs, in the 1920s at Browning's urging. In June 1931, MGM production supervisor, Irving Thalberg, offered Browning the opportunity to direct ArsÃƒÂ¨ne Lupin with John Barrymore. Browning declined, preferring to develop Freaks, a project he had started as early as 1927. Screenwriters Willis Goldbeck \n\nand Elliott Clawson were assigned to the project at Browning's request. Leon Gordon, Edgar Allan Woolf, Al Boasberg and an uncredited Charles MacArthur would also contribute to the script. The script was shaped over five months. Little of the original story was retained beyond the marriage between a midget and an average-sized woman and their wedding feast. Victor McLaglen was considered for the role of Hercules, whilst Myrna Loy was initially slated to star as Cleopatra, with Jean Harlow as Venus. Ultimately, Thalberg decided not to cast any major stars in the picture.\n\nFreaks began filming in October 1931 and was completed in December. Following disastrous test screenings in January 1932 (one woman threatened to sue MGM, claiming the film had caused her to suffer a miscarriage),[5] the studio cut the picture down from its original 90-minute running time to just over an hour. Much of the sequence of the freaks attacking Cleopatra, as she lay under a tree, was removed, as well as a gruesome sequence showing Hercules being castrated, a number of comedy sequences, and most of the film's original epilogue. A new prologue featuring a carnival barker was added, as was the new epilogue featuring the reconciliation of the tiny lovers. This shortened version Ã¢â‚¬â€ now only 64 minutes long Ã¢â‚¬â€ had its premiere at the Fox Criterion in Los Angeles on February 20, 1932.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 4999 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages:English, French\nRunTime 79 mins\nSubtitles: English, Espanol, Francais\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 79 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c882ca18f97f77f0c515160342a1cc69c1d697b5","amp;dn":"Freaks+%281932%29+DVD9+-+Horror+%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c882ca18f97f77f0c515160342a1cc69c1d697b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,130,202,24,249,127,119,240,197,21,22,3,66,161,204,105,193,214,151,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
