Competition has become increasingly important in the postal sector for some time in the form of alternative entrants providing mail delivery.\n\nHowever, the competition from information and communications technologies (ICT) in the form of email and instant messaging, the Internet, Facebook and other forms of social networking and portable wireless devises such as the iPad and Kindle may be even more significant.Mail volumes are falling and the economies of scale that have made possible daily deliveries to every address are being eroded. This book assesses volume these declines resulting from this so-called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“eSubstituionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and looks at the ways the postal sector can adapt to the rapid changes resulting from ICT.\n\nThe impact of electronic invoicing on transactions mail, and the impact on bulk mail of electronic forms of advertising are examined. Strategies, including pricing and access policies, are discussed in the context of the increasing impact of ICT. A rethinking of the role of mail in an electronic age is taking place and this book provides the cutting-edge of this rethinking and the attempts of POs to reinvent themselves while continuing to meet the publicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s expectation of continuing ubiquitous daily deliveries of traditional mail products. Undergraduate and postgraduate students and researchers in regulation, competition law, innovation and public sector economics along with institutional libraries and industry professionals will find this volume informative and useful.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a382783f35a504641e29f9abcbdef5f546b0529f","amp;dn":"Reinventing+The+Postal+Sector+In+An+Electronic+Age+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a382783f35a504641e29f9abcbdef5f546b0529f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,130,120,63,53,165,4,100,30,41,249,171,203,222,245,245,70,176,82,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
