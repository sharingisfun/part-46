All of these scientists, engineers, wild-eyed geniuses, and amateur technologists have dedicated their lives to the pursuit of that singular Eureka! moment in their laboratories or garages. Each has altered the modern world as we know it in some significant way.\n\nThe conversations will show budding tinkerers, professional inventors, educators, and onlookers how the top minds in the field come up with ideas and manage the first steps of inspiration, how they experiment productively, how they Ã¢â‚¬Å“sellÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ ideas to others and secure funding, how they execute the final product, and how they commercialize and protect their work. All inventors will learn from these conversations, whether they are exploring new chemical compounds in million-dollar labs or perfecting a household gadget or toy in a basement workshop","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f595d2c58c6a3fd70907fbd762da6156cfeb1b7a","amp;dn":"Inventors+at+Work%3AMinds+and+Motivation+Behind+Modern+Inventions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f595d2c58c6a3fd70907fbd762da6156cfeb1b7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,149,210,197,140,106,63,215,9,7,251,215,98,218,97,86,207,235,27,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
