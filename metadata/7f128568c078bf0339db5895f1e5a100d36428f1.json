Everything you need for fabulous roleplaying adventure is contained in a single volume that has been designed to support any genre of fantasy. The game retains all the key concepts and hallmarks of its earlier versions, but requires no familiarity with the previous editions.\n\nIn RuneQuest your characters are defined by their culture, career, community, background, comrades, skills, magic and cults. Progression is through skill advancement Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not levels or similarly abstract concepts. As your characters adventure and quest, their capabilities improve and their relationships deepen and strengthen. Players and Games Masters have complete flexibility over what can be achieved, and the way characters develop is entirely dependent on choices players make, depending on their charactersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ aspirations and motivations.\n\nGames Masters receive a huge amount of support through the RuneQuest rules. All the concepts and game mechanics are explained clearly with options and considerations explored and presented for ease of use. You need only this rulebook for many years of exciting and imaginative play.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f128568c078bf0339db5895f1e5a100d36428f1","amp;dn":"The+Design+Mechanism","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f128568c078bf0339db5895f1e5a100d36428f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,18,133,104,192,120,191,3,57,219,88,149,241,229,161,0,211,100,40,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
