I found complete Colorado Kid and Blaze, but also new book from november 2009 Under The Dome. On writing is also there. One more thing: Buy your favourite books from King, cause it is much prettier when you feel paper underneath your hands.\n\nList of written works in update part:\n\n1956\n\nJhonathan And The Witches\n\n1960\n\nHotel At The End Of The Road\nI've Got To Get Away\nNever Look Behind You\nThe Cursed Expedition\nThe Other Side Of The Fog\nThe Stranger\nThe Stranger\n\n1965\n\nKing, Stephen - In a Half-World of Terror\n\n1968\n\nKing, Stephen - Harrison State Park '68\n\n1970\n\nKing, Stephen - Slade\n\n1971\n\nIn The Key - Chords Of Dawn\nThe Hardcase Speaks\n\n1978\n\nKing, Stephen - The King Family and the Wicked Witch\nSquad D\n\n1980\n\nThe Crate\n\n1981\n\nThe Blue Air Compressor\n\n1982\n\nSkybar\n\n1984\n\nKing, Stephen - The Night of the Tiger\n\n1988\n\nKing, Stephen - The Reploids\n\n1990\n\nAn Evening At Gods\n\n1997\n\nBefore The Play (TV Guide)\n\n2002\n\nKing, Stephen - The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer - My Life at Rose Red\n\n2005\n\nColorado Kid\n\n2006\n\nRichard Bachman [Stephen King] - Blaze\n\n2009\n\nStephen King - Under The Dome\n\nUnpublished:\n\nKing, Stephen - Chinga\nKing, Stephen - My Little Serrated Security Blanket\nThe Leprechaun\nThe Collective","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a030a37e3e38feea6405b440e53ad6aaef9f6ae","amp;dn":"Update+part+to+bibliography+of+Stephen+King","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a030a37e3e38feea6405b440e53ad6aaef9f6ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,3,10,55,227,227,143,238,166,64,91,68,14,83,173,106,174,249,246,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
