Fight thousands of zombie mutants and their bosses in frantic bloody gameplay while earning over 70 perks.\n\nAugust 17, 1977\nScattered groups of zombies infiltrate remote Midwestern towns. Incapable of using tools or weapons, the invaders are resisted until they retreat back into the desert. Special elimination posses are set up to hunt down any of the surviving undead. Six weeks after the squads started their search-and-destroy mission, the last known zombie was shot and killed.\n\nPresent-day\nOver thirty years had passed when a truck driver traveling down a desolate Arizona road plows into a wall of undead. Before the driver's phone signal went dead, he reported some were carrying guns... They're back and now they are hunting us.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8c017ae9ad165ccfb0ac6198afe4dfcb52f7056","amp;dn":"Nation+Red+%7E+.%3A+%5BMAC%5D+%3A.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8c017ae9ad165ccfb0ac6198afe4dfcb52f7056","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,192,23,174,154,209,101,204,251,10,198,25,138,254,77,252,181,47,112,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
