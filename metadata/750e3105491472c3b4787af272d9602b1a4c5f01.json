All aspects of material development, manufacturing and engineering will be covered including production, processing and application of magnesium and its alloys; research and practical implementation of magnesium injection molding and die casting; semisolid processing of alloys and composites. Magnesium injection molding is used to manufacture millions of components from magnesium alloys for various applications, including computer, camera and consumer electronic housings; automotive parts; sporting goods; and household and office equipment","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:750e3105491472c3b4787af272d9602b1a4c5f01","amp;dn":"Magnesium+Injection+Molding+-+Frank+Czerwinski","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"750e3105491472c3b4787af272d9602b1a4c5f01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,14,49,5,73,20,114,195,180,120,122,242,114,217,96,43,26,76,95,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
