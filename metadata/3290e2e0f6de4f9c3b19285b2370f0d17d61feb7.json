A crunchy oatmeal crisp made with mid-summerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nectarines and raspberries. Or a comforting pear bread pudding to soften a harsh winterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s day. Simple, scrumptious, cherishedÃ¢â‚¬â€œthese heritage desserts featuring local fruit are thankfully experiencing a long-due revival.\n\nIn Rustic Fruit Desserts, each seasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bounty inspires unique ways to showcase the distinct flavor combinations that appear fleetingly. James Beard AwardÃ¢â‚¬â€winning chef Cory Schreiber teams up with Julie Richardson, owner of PortlandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Baker &amp; Spice, to showcase the freshest fruit available amidst a repertoire of satisfying old-timey fruit desserts, including crumbles, crisps, buckles, and pies.\n\nWhether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re searching for the perfect ending to a sit-down dinner party or a delicious sweet to wrap up any night of the week, these broadly appealing and easy-to-prepare classics will become family favorites. \n\n\nCory Schreiber is the founder of Wildwood Restaurant and winner of the James Beard Award for Best Chef: Pacific Northwest. Schreiber now works with the Oregon Department of Agriculture as the Farm-to-School Food Coordinator and writes, consults, and teaches cooking classes in Portland, Oregon.\n\nA graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, Julie Richardson grew up enjoying the flavors that defined the changing seasons of her Vermont childhood. Her lively small-batch bakery, Baker &amp; Spice, evolved from her involvement in the Portland and Hillsdale farmersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ markets. She lives in Portland, Oregon.\n\n\n\n\nBy Cory Schreiber, Julie Richardson\nPublished by Ten Speed Press in 2009\nEPUB, Retail, 176 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3290e2e0f6de4f9c3b19285b2370f0d17d61feb7","amp;dn":"Rustic+Fruit+Desserts+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3290e2e0f6de4f9c3b19285b2370f0d17d61feb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,144,226,224,246,222,79,156,59,25,40,91,35,112,240,209,125,97,254,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
