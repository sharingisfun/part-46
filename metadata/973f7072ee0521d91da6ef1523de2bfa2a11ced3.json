The song was one of his biggest hit singles in his home country, the United States, peaking at #7 on the singles chart, while peaking at #2 in the UK, only being held off the top spot by hit dance record, &quot;Swing the Mood&quot; by Jive Bunny &amp; The Mastermixers.\n\nThe lyrics describe the narrator's love for a femme fatale, but it has been speculated that the woman may not be &quot;the poison running inside my [Cooper's] veins, and may refer to Alice's alcoholism from the decade before.&quot; The song changes key four times in the chorus, quite unusual in a straight rock song.\n\nTrash is a studio album released by heavy metal singer Alice Cooper in 1989.\n\nThe album featured &quot;Poison&quot;, Cooper's first top ten hit since his single &quot;You And Me&quot; in 1977. After Alice's return to the music industry in 1986 with the successful tour &quot;The Nightmare Returns&quot;, Cooper had sought assistance from Desmond Child to create a comeback album. Trash became one of Cooper's biggest albums, accompanied by music videos for &quot;Poison&quot;, &quot;Bed of Nails&quot;, &quot;House of Fire&quot;, and &quot;Only My Heart Talkin'&quot;. A successful year-long worldwide concert tour in support of the album was documented in the home video release Alice Cooper Trashes The World.\n\nThe album features many guest performances including Jon Bon Jovi, Steven Tyler, and Kane Roberts, who left the Alice Cooper line-up after the 1987-88 World Tour.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:973f7072ee0521d91da6ef1523de2bfa2a11ced3","amp;dn":"Alice+Cooper+-+Poison","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"973f7072ee0521d91da6ef1523de2bfa2a11ced3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,63,112,114,238,5,33,217,29,166,239,21,35,222,43,250,42,17,206,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
