Typically experimental, 'The Eternal' sees guitarist Thurston Moore and his bassist wife Kim Gordon joined, notably, by ex-Pavement member Mark Ibold. Musically, this release shows the band at their hard-rocking best, with songs of unity and artistic tribute like 'What We Know' and 'Leaky Lifeboat' standingout.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2f14d6a58e39e6c07a6c8aa861f7416d5d767d5","amp;dn":"Sonic+Youth+-+The+Eternal+%5B2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2f14d6a58e39e6c07a6c8aa861f7416d5d767d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,241,77,106,88,227,158,108,7,166,200,170,134,31,116,22,213,215,103,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
