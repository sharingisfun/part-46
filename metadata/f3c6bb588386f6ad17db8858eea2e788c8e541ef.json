So many books have been uploaded, so many\ncracks made, and so many torrents reloaded! A site has gone through major changes, then it was killed and out of the ashes\nrose a more prestine and beautiful website. &quot;tta64&quot; on The Pirate Bay is now V.I.P. level, and on Kick Ass Torrents is now\nVUL (Verified Uploader) status. \n&quot;MastermindTTA&quot; had really gotten far. And it all started as a dream. It first started as an idea. Think of it first made\nas a paper mask, weak, but full of potential. And slowly this mask has become so attached to me, it's my alternate skin\nand it's solidified so much it could be of steel. If this metaphor means anything, it's that you guys are what makes my\nscreen name MastermindTTA a proud title I can carry around; no matter how foolish it sounds.\n\nThank you all.\n\nCycle:\nSpring &lt;---\nSummer\nAutumn\nWinter\n\nFormat: Archive (.rar), eBook (.epub)\n\nThis bundle contains over 60 series and books (released as torrents).
