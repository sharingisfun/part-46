In fact if you download and print the materials for this release of the game you will not need any other things from the original game. All the plastic miniatures and the furnitures are replaced by paper models that you can fold by yourself. These models can not be found on any other place on internet. They are all made especially for this release of the game by me (except for the furniture models that I took from worldworksgames - sorry guys I admire your work but I couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t found nothing else that I could use).\nYou can check these screens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img57.imageshack.us/my.php?image=monsterminiaturesoptionoy8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img57.imageshack.us/my.php?image=monsterminiaturesoptionoy8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/my.php?image=tilesandherominiaturesyh7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/my.php?image=tilesandherominiaturesyh7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img57.imageshack.us/my.php?image=questtreasurecardstc0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img57.imageshack.us/my.php?image=questtreasurecardstc0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/my.php?image=furnituresoptionalvijvsjg2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/my.php?image=furnituresoptionalvijvsjg2.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll the materials were collected from various sites over the internet then prepeared for quality printing. They are all packed in PDF documents A4 format on 300 dpi !!!\n\nThe translation and preparation for printing of the materials took me somewhere a year I think and it was hell of a work, so give credits.\n\nIf you don't understand Bulgarian ... sorry about that.\nI left the original books in english too, but the cards are all translated. Anyway you can still download this torrent and use the paper miniatures and the supplementary materials some of which are 2 pc games, some videos and other cool stuff that i collected for the last year.\n\n\nAt the end IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d like to say that this is probably the ultimate Hero Quest package youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll find on the internet and every true fan of the game should have it. (...but - I repeat it's in Bulgarian).\n\nI hope you like it anyway.\n\n\nThe Ink ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43f5135dd638b6b22cb67757677200c515b4a4a1","amp;dn":"Hero+Quest+BG+v+0.1%28Board+Game%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43f5135dd638b6b22cb67757677200c515b4a4a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,245,19,93,214,56,182,178,44,182,119,87,103,114,0,197,21,180,164,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
