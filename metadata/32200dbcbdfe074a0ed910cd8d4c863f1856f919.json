And Making It Work: Six Steps for Putting Both Your Career and Your Family First\n\n\nPublisher: Prentice Hall \n\nD. Quinn Mills\nSasha K. Mattu\nKirstin R. Hornby\n\nISBN: 0131440225 \nedition 2004 \nPDF \n139 pages \nENGLISH\n10.3 MB\n\n\nWorking 24x7? Delaying life until it's too late? You have the ability stop! Having it All ...and Making it Work is a fast-paced, easy-to-use book offering you a new pathway towards managing personal life and professional life--without sacrificing either one of them. This book isn't just more whining and exhortation: it delivers specific, bite-sized, no-fluff solutions for managing your life, including crucial execution steps you can take immediately. \n\nMills teaches you how to identify and balance what's most important to you--and give up what you don't want badly enough. He also shows how to make the balance real, not just talk; how to make career decisions that promote balance; and how to make course corrections that refine your balance over time. Mills also exposes the potentially disastrous myths and rationalizations many people use to avoid the realities of work/life imbalance--fallacies like &quot;I'll devote all my time to work for 15 years, get rich, and then I'll pay attention to family.&quot; Mills' breakthrough work/life courses at the Harvard Business School are helping business people find the balance they're searching for. The techniques he's developed will help anyone struggling to get a grasp on the work/life balance challenge..............\n\n\n[/color][/code][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32200dbcbdfe074a0ed910cd8d4c863f1856f919","amp;dn":"Having+It+All+...+And+Making+It+Work%3A+Six+Steps+for+Putting+Both","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32200dbcbdfe074a0ed910cd8d4c863f1856f919","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,32,13,188,189,254,7,74,14,217,16,205,141,76,134,63,24,86,249,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
