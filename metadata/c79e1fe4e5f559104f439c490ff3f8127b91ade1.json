(Although I have just added a single-page mode which should suit tablet PCs in portrait mode) Next, the pages turn when you click them, just like a real book. Finally, you can also select a textured background to make the pages look like real paper. yBook will read html files, text files, rtf files and pdb/prc files (Palm document format).\nFeatures:\n\nRuns on any Windows PC (Win95 or later)\nDisplay your book on side-by-side or single pages.\nResize the pages, adjust the margins, set text and paper colour.\nText, html and RTF reader\nPDB and PRC reader\nSearch for words or phrases\nAutomatic bookmarks\nText sizes from tiny to HUGE\nNo zooming, panning or scrolling\nDirect download of all Gutenberg titles, with index.\nInternationalised menus - Spanish, German, etc\nCompletely free to use: No registration, no adware, no spyware","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c79e1fe4e5f559104f439c490ff3f8127b91ade1","amp;dn":"yBook+1.4.83+multilanguage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c79e1fe4e5f559104f439c490ff3f8127b91ade1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,158,31,228,229,245,89,16,79,67,156,73,15,243,248,18,123,145,173,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
