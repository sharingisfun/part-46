Basically, they're fighters and killers, living from war to war through U.S. history. In modern times, a U.S. colonel, Stryker, recruits them and other mutants as commandos. Logan quits and becomes a logger, falling in love with a local teacher. When Logan refuses to rejoin Stryker's crew, the colonel sends the murderous Victor. Logan now wants revenge. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458525/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458525/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThanks for Downloading!\n\nEnjoy, and Please Seed!\n\n~Wolftatt2~","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8072ddc322aa0d2c3c1de3b181601ac9ac945f0f","amp;dn":"X%7EMen+Origins%7EWolverine+%7B2009%7D+DVDRip.Xvid%7EWolftatt2%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8072ddc322aa0d2c3c1de3b181601ac9ac945f0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,114,221,195,34,170,13,44,60,29,227,177,129,96,26,201,172,148,95,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
