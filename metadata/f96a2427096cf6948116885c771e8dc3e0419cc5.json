In 1980 and 1981 Circle set up their equipment in three different night clubs to record Chet Baker and his group on the particular nights. These sessions resulted in ten LP records and two CDs. The LPs run in length from 37 minutes to almost 60 minutes.\n\nThe third session at the Salt Peanuts Club in Koln in my opinion is the best of the bunch. Dennis Luxion is back on piano with Rocky Knauer and Burkhart Ruckert on bass and drums, but there are three horns on the front line now. Bob Mover, an alto saxophonist who played some in the early 70s with Chet is back on alto and Jon Eardly, who was the first trumpet player to take ChetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s place with the Mulligan quartet, is playing fluglehorn.\n\nThe numbers from the three nights at the Salt Peanuts feature some great heads. For those that might not know, a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“headÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is an arrangement that is not written down. It is usually worked out in a rehersal session and is played that way from then on. EardleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mellow fluglehorn and MoverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s alto blend with ChetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s trumpet to create a warm, pleasing sound together and a backdrop for some of the solos.&quot;\n\nPersonnel:\nChet Baker (trumpet, vocal)\nJon Eardley (flugelhorn)\nBob Mover (soprano and alto sax)\nDennis Luxion (piano)\nRocky Knauer (bass)\nBurkhart Ruckert (drums) \n\nChet Baker - Round Midnight Tracks:\n01  Prayer For The Newborn (7ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ 08 )\n02  My Ideal (8ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ 16)\n03  Lady Bird (7ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢13)\n04  Round Midnight (9ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ 37)\n05  Same RiversÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Beatrice (14ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ 45)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f96a2427096cf6948116885c771e8dc3e0419cc5","amp;dn":"Chet+Baker+-+Round+Midnight%2C+Live+%281981%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5Bs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f96a2427096cf6948116885c771e8dc3e0419cc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,106,36,39,9,108,246,148,129,22,136,92,119,30,141,195,224,65,156,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
