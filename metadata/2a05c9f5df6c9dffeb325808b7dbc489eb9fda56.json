The answer to the above question is easy, but it's different for each listener. \n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a05c9f5df6c9dffeb325808b7dbc489eb9fda56","amp;dn":"Officium+-+Jan+Gabarek+%26+The+Hilliard+Ensemble","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a05c9f5df6c9dffeb325808b7dbc489eb9fda56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,5,201,245,223,108,157,255,235,50,88,8,183,219,196,137,235,159,218,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
